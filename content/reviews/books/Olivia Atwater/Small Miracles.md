> Chocolate shouldn't be a sin at all. Everyone deserves a bit of chocolate.

Gadriel, a former (now fallen) Guardian Angel owes her angelic bookie[^bookie]. And all she has to do to come clear is to tempt one sinless mortal--Holly Harker. Should be easy, it's what she does now...

[^bookie]: That's certainly a concept...

So of course wacky hijinks ensue, things go wrong, people get hurt (not badly, it's not that sort of book), and just perhaps--everyone comes out of it a bit better than they went in. 

> Believe me, plenty of people claim they love someone because they get the warm fuzzies around them - but love is something you do. Quite often, it's something you choose.

It's such a fun reading, reminding me fairly strongly of [[Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch|Good Omens]]()[^goodthing]. Both in theme, but also in style. It's a little bit irreverent, a little bit touching, and a lot of fun.

[^goodthing]: [[Neil Gaiman]]() may be coming out in the news as creepy at best. I still do enjoy a great many of his works. Plus, the late Terry Pratchett remains a delight and I think this tends more towards his inspiration. That makes [[Nine Goblins|two books]]() I've read recently that reminded me of Pratchett's work. 

Structurally, the near constant footnotes detailing what is/isn't a sin (points, [[The Good Place]]() style) and the running score for Holly and her niece are a lot of fun. I didn't expect that to work as well in an audiobook as it did, but each time I heard that little chime, I got a little smile. 

[^footnote]: (A footnote)â€…Inspiring good deeds in others gains one half the value of the action so inspired. In this respect, particularly contagious good deeds can be compared to pyramid schemes.

Overall, another good read (on a bit of a run of those!). Well worth a try.
