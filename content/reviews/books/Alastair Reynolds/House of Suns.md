> Everything came and went, everything was new and bright with promise once and old and worn out later, and everything left a small, diminishing stain on eternity, a mark that time would eventually erase.

House of Suns is what really great sci-fi tries to be: it takes some fascinating ideas (generally technological), sprinkles in interesting characters (although some authors seem to find that optional), and goes from there. 

<!--more-->

In House of Suns, we have the story of a small subset of humanity writ large. The speed of light is the ultimate limit. Planets are decades apart; the galaxy hundreds of thousands of years around. So how do you continue that oh so human drive for exploration and expansion?

Well in House of Suns, you create a thousand clones. Imprint them all with your memories. And send them out into the universe. Set it up so that ever few decades/centuries/millenia, they meet up, share all they've been to. What other branches of humanity have risen--or fallen? What other miracles of technology have been discovered? Who's fallen in love? 

It's a great idea and oh the scope. You have time dilation from traveling near the speed of light. The ability to slow time within a small region to millions of times. Lifetimes spanning millions of years. 

And one big mystery, to top it all off. 

Andromeda is missing. 

Someone seems to have a vendetta against one particular Line of clones. 

Murder. 

Machine people. 

Lies within lies. Secret societies within secret societies. 

Vengeance. 

Oh, it's a good book. Bit hefty. Ends with a closure--but a heaping helping of *now what?*. Give it a read (I listened to the audiobook; it's well narrated).
