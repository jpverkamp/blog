> Let the [[Lord of Chaos]]() rule.

Rand is trying to rule Cairhien and Caemlyn, Tear and the Aiel. Egwene is {{< spoiler >}}raised Amyrlin Seat{{< /spoiler >}}  . Nynaeve discovers how to Heal that which should be impossible to heal. Mat begins to build an army and finds himself bullied into following Elayne and Nynaeve to Ebou Dar.

And right at the end, in a far shorter segment than I remembered,  {{< spoiler >}}Rand is kidnapped by Elaida's Aes Sadai, tortured, and saved in a battle between the Aes Sedai, Aiel (on both sides), and the first demonstration of Asha'man as weapons.{{< /spoiler >}}  

> Kneel and swear to the Lord Dragon, or you will be knelt.

There's a reason that's often described as one of the most intense scenes in the entire series...  

The [[Lord of Chaos]]() is quite a book. Well worth the read.
