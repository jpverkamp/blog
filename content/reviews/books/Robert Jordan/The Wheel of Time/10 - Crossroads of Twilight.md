> Life is a dream, and everyone wakes eventually.

Elayne continuing to solidify her hold in Caemlyn, all while being pregnant. Okay then.  

<!--more-->

Mat and Tuon in Valan Luca's show? Not bad. I like seeing the world building. Mat is amusing.  

Perrin seeking Faile, growing harder all the while? Intense, but longer than it needs to be.  

It's interesting to see how everyone from all over the world reacts to the Cleansing of Saidin in the previous book. Cements just how much Power they were using...  

Overall, it feels like not much happens. Luckily everything starts speeding up again in {{< goodreads book="Knife of Dreams" >}}.
