It's more Dresden at least!  

It wasn't great, but we get a lot more of Molly in her apprentice level, which I feel was somewhat skipped over in the novels.

Plus:

Marcone, Hendricks, and Guard. I ... didn't really picture any of them that way, but it works!  

And Bob's always a hoot:

I think the other break out of this one is the villain:  

![Down-Town-3-Throne-of-Sewage](/embeds/books/attachments/down-town-3-throne-of-sewage.png)  

A THRONE OF SEWAGE! He's cartoonishly evil, but ... it's a comic book based on an urban fantasy series. It works. Plus, you get sludge monsters:

Good enough to read for a completionist's sake.
