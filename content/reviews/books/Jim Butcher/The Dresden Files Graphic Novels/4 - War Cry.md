War Cry! The second new Dresden comic!  

It almost feels like a [bottle episode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottle_episode) in that it's very limited in scope, but the action and explosions certainly would have cost a fair penny. There's something underhanded going on, an attack by hundreds of red court vampires, and Dresden coming into his role as a mentor warden. It's pretty good.

It's funny because things break down around Wizards. I wonder why they don't have a better way than running? Nice to see Yoki Yoshimo. We haven't seen her since Dead Beat and in the main series, nothing other than a comment in White Night as Dresden tries to trace down the history of the Swords[^king].

It's greatly amusing to me how stuck old creatures can get in their ways.  

Finally, fairly major spoilers to the plot:  

It's fascinating to see an actual  {{< spoiler >}}shoggoth{{< /spoiler >}}  in the series for what I think is the first time. We've had increasingly many hints about  {{< spoiler >}}Outsiders and truly alien beings{{< /spoiler >}}  , but is this the first time chronologically that we've seen something quite like this? It's pretty crazy.  

[^king]: As a random aside, it's interesting how big a deal is made of the Swords go to someone descended from a King. Basically everyone is. [Is Everyone a Descendant of Royalty?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Uce4fG4R0)
