It's certainly a bit different--there's less room to breath and less freedom to imagine the characters as you want, but on the other hand, it's more Dresden Files!  

<!--more-->

In a nutshell, you have a murder at a zoo. Might be something on the spooky side, so Dresden gets involved.

And of course he's as snarky as can be:

At times, it feels a bit overdone, which is saying something for Dresden. You get a snarky comment a page and it's almost to the point of a caricature:

But you know what? I'll take it.  

Plus, COMIC BOOK SOUNDS!

Even though the art seems a little odd at times (eyes in particular and proportions are way overblown, although that's more obvious in [[Storm Front (Graphic Novel)]]()), it really fits a comic book.  

Alltother, don't read it instead of the novels, but there's absolutely no reason not to give both a try!
