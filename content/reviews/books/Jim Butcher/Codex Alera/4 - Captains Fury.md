{{< goodreads book="Captain's Fury" text=" Captain's Fury " >}} takes the 'Alera at war' feel of {{< goodreads book="Cursor's Fury" text=" Cursor's Fury " >}} and really turns it up a notch. Tavi has done the impossible and fought a war against the Canim for two years now, holding them in place and building the trust of his followers to impressive levels. But now a new foe is coming for him--a foe far more terrifying than the Canim, or even than the Vord (who are much less interesting when you don't see them on screen for a book or two)... politicians.  

Characterwise, Tavi remains among the best part of these books:

Although to be fair, the characters surrounding him are well done as well. Kitai is just different enough to be interesting and Max/Ehren/Crassus shine in both Legion and Cursor scenes. You want to root for Amara and Bernard, pushed through as much as they are, even when things go sidewise--although that hike across what feels like most of Alera could certainly have been shorter. The Senator earns the hate coming his way.  

There aren't huge strides in world building in this book, mostly filling in the cracks. But one thing... do you remember how in {{< goodreads book="Cursor's Fury" text=" Cursor's Fury " >}} , I commented on how awe inspiring it was to see a High Lady let loose? Well. Now you get the First Lord himself. Oy. We'll leave it at that.  

Overall, this is probably the weakest book of the series since the first, but only because there has to be a weakest book. It's still a wonderful read and I couldn't put down my headphones through long parts of it. The parts towards the end where Gaius  {{< spoiler >}}sets off a volcano{{< /spoiler >}} just as Tavi  {{< spoiler >}}proclaims himself Gauis Octavian{{< /spoiler >}}  . That's writing.  

It's a pity there are only two more to go...
