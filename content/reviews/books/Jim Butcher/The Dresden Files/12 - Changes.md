** spoiler alert ** Damn.  

In the first chapter of Changes, Dresden learns he has a daughter. Throughout the book, he loses everything (his car, his office, his home...). He makes deals he promised he would never make.  

<!--more-->

He takes on archangel-tier baddies--and wins. He takes on the Red Court and kills them all.  

And in the last chapter, he's shot. Presumably fatally.  {{< spoiler >}}(Although given that this is book 12 out of a planned more than 20...{{< /spoiler >}}  

I remember the first time I read this book. Ghost Story wasn't out yet. That was a long wait. Time time around, I can start immediately (and know what actually happened). That's doesn't make this stories impact and less.  

Another thing that has changed since I last read Ghost Story? I have a daughter now. Younger than Maggie, but still. If I were in the same situation; if I had to make the choices Dresden made?  

The best Dresden Files thus far, by a decent margin. Where can it even go from here?
