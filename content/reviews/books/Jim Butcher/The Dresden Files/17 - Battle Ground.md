That right there. {{< goodreads book="Battle Ground" >}} That is the second half of {{< goodreads book="Peace Talks" >}}. They should have been one book, and are best read back to back like that. But so it goes.  

<!--more-->

Man that's just one big battle. There are a few chances to breathe, but they're few and far between. For the most part, Dresden pulls out one crazy solution after another to problems no one decades (or centuries) his senior should have to deal with.  

And man. There are a few big changes in the book. It will be crazy to see what will happen in the next year/book. We'll just have to wait and see. And may be Jim Butcher be in such a state where the wait for the next book isn't quite so long.  

I think the main problem I had with the book was just how often Dresden seems able to successfully hit well above his weight class. There are literally gods and protogods, powers of all sorts, duking it out. And Dresden is the one that has to save him? Stretching it a bit there.  

Well worth the read and I look forward to seeing what's next.
