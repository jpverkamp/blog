Well that's certainly a thing.  

Almost exactly 4 years and what feels a lifetime ago (January 2017), I read the prose version of [[Neverwhere]](). I didn't actually know it *had a graphic novel version (there are a number of other books in this category I'm finding). But looking back, I'm so very glad it does. The prose version of the story was weird and fantastical and wonderful--and the graphic novel turns that all up to 11, given form to all the strange characters and settings of London Below.

Right from the very beginning, we have Door on the run with her white face and keyhole eye (they never really explain that do they), some magic jsut barely hinted at so far.  

Only for things to escalate quickly, with a body (not quite dead) on the street, a fateful descision made, and an apartment full of pigeons.

London Above! And now we're really getting into the story.  

What follows (as I mentioned in  is a perfect sort of portal fantasy. Falling into another world just on the otherside of our own; often (as is the case here) full of wonder and magic. And of course some sort of terrible plot or another, otherwise why would we be reading about it?  

It's a wonderful story and the graphic novel format really does fit this story well. I really recommend both the novel and this form, but if you're going to just read one, I think the graphic novel can stand alone.  

Well worth the read.  

A few more random pictures I found interesting/awesome. Spoilers!

The Marquis de Carabas is a shadow. I don't know if that was mentioned in the novel, but either way, it's an entirely disconcerting effect...

Heh. Cultural confusion. Tasty cats.

Anaesthesia is a fun character. I wonder if (like in Gainman's [[The Sandman|Sandman series]]() that's a Title or just a name. We never do find out, but for what little she's about, she's a fun character.

Helping. And a wonderful quote.  

![Neverwhere-8](/embeds/books/attachments/neverwhere-8.jpg)  

Oh the Angel Islington. Angels, especially fallen angels are among my favorite characters in novels. There's just something about a perfect being, one who actually has had a chance to know and to meet God--and turned away nevertheless.

Oh Coup and Vandermar. Such terrifying ridiculousosity.
