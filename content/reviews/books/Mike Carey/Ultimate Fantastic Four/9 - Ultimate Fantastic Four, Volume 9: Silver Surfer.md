A perfect Utopia. 

As problematic as one might imagine digging any deeper. 

A Searcher—Surfer?—seeking those to fill it. 

And Reed Richards, calling out into the universe for anyone—or anything—that night be out there listening. 

It’s an interesting story, if a bit of a lackluster ending. 

I do find it interesting how far the power scale in the Marvel Universe(s) goes. Uber powerful, unkillable monsters like the Hulk… and there’s always a bigger fish(tm). 

Onward.

… he seems to do that a lot.

I give it 3-4 pages until he breaks out. 

Later: a bit less than 2.

Quite a name.
