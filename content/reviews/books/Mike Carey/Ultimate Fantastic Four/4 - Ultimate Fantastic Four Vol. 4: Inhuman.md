Story the first: 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-fantastic-four-v4-6f7f18.png)

New art. New baddie (once again fallout of the Baxter Building policies). Not the easiest story to follow. 

Story the second:

![](/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-fantastic-four-v4-ba46d0.png)

Lockjaw. Inhumans. Introducedâ€¦ and gone in an episode. Weird that. 

Story the third:

Mole Man? Seriously

Three rather strange stories and not a real useful or reasonable change among them. Oy. 

Onward to something better.
