You know, that might actually be my favorite Ultimate Fantastic Four? Team drama, mysterious new threat, tie backs to Atlantis and Namor. 

Itâ€™s actually pretty good. 

Weird. But good. 

It's a pity that this is the last of the series... Why couldn't we have had more of this? Or really a more coherent storyline throughout the run. 

Onward!

Weird. Cool. 

It took me a minute to connect that to the Seven. Not exactly subtle, but I still missed it.
