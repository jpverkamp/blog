Wait... *that* Fables. Confused for a bit. Those people all sounded familiar... but not from Unwritten.

Not at all what I expected, but most appreciated. It's great to see a number of old faces again, it's been a while since I read Fables. They fit together about as strangely as you'd imagine.

Onward!

Yup. It's that sort of story.

It's been a bit... but I don't remember this plot line in particular. 

Neat!
