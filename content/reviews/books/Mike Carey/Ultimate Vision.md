The idea of Vision is pretty cool. One to remember and to warn. 

The idea that no one else has beaten Galactus is… nonsensical? Bit comics. 

Vision… with a rather female form is an interesting choice. No reason not to choose either over the other when approaching Earth. But I expect that’s not why they (the writers/illustrators) did it…

So now we get a quick aside with A.I.M. and a left behind splinter of Galactus. Neat story, if likely inconsequential to anything else. 

Onward!
