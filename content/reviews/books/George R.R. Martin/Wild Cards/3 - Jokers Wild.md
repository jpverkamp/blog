Rather than the collection of short stories found in [[Wild Cards]]() and [[Aces High]](), [[Jokers Wild]]() is instead a mosaic novel, with the storylines all mixed into a single novel length story, with less clear distinction between the characters and their storylines.  

I'm ... not thrilled with it.

In the previous case, if you didn't like a particularly story, it wasn't long before you moved on to something completely different. Here, it just keeps coming back again and again. Particularly when Jokers Wild primarily deals with Fortunato/Astronomer and the Egyptian Masons, which I've mentioned before wasn't my favorite plotline.  

Really, there wasn't much that I cared overmuch about in this book. Seeing Bagabond's dealings with the animal and human worlds was interesting enough. Wraith remains a ridiculous character (a cat burglar who can phase through walls--but only when nearly naked), but her story was fairly interesting. And Hiram Worchester has a lot of potential. So there's something going for it.  

Still. I'm hoping for more in [[Aces Abroad]]().
