My oldest started reading not that long ago and oh how they've taken it to heart. Immediately into just about everything they can get their hands on. One of which? 

Nate the Great!

They vary a bit in quality, but 'Stalks Stupidweed' is pretty high up there in my opinion. It's cute and has a few laugh out loud moments. Worth a try (especially if you've read the first 8). :D
