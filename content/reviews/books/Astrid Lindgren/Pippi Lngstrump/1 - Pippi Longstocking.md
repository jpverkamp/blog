Pippi Longstocking's a bit of an odd character. On one hand, she's a fun loving young girl who happens to have super strength (for some reason). She's lived a pretty crazy life and has stories from all over the world along with a tendency to get herself into (and back out of) wacky adventures and always seems to have a lot of fun doing so. 

On the other hand, she's a young girl living on her own. Her parents are (probably) both dead, so she doesn't really have any guiding influence on her life. On top of that, she doesn't exactly seem to have the strongest grasp on reality--always telling stories from around the world with only a vague relation to real life. 

All together, I'm not really sure what to think of it. They're certainly cute enough stories and if you take them on the surface level--as stories that were originally written to make a sick nine year old girl feel better--they're pretty great. Just don't dig any deeper...

(And apparently there are sequels? Guess I know what's next...)
