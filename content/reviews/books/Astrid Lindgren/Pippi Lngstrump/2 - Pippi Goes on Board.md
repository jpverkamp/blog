I actually liked this story a lot more than the first Pippi. It's still basically the same idea: girl who is unusually strong and lives on her own gets up to hijinks, but I think that the stories this time around fit a little bit--and we actually get to meet {{< spoiler >}}Pippi's dad--turns out he's not dead after all{{</ spoiler >}}. 

Worth continuing on. Going to have to check out the third now.
