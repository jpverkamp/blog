Well, that's a cute little story for what it is. And my daughter really enjoyed it. 

Basically, oldentimes life on an island. Yearly, all the people on the island go across to another one, round up wild horses, and drive them across the island to train and sell. 

And of course our young protagonists find the horse of their dreams and go through everything to find and bring her back. 

It's cute. 

Side note, it's fun finding out that Misty was a real horse! Although, perhaps don't read too far into all that [inspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misty_of_Chincoteague_(novel))...

Onward!
