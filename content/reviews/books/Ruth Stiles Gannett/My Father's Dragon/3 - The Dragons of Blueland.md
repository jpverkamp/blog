Elmer is finally home! And now Boris can go home as well. 

Only to immediately run into trouble (his family has been trapped!) and fly all the way back to pick up the one friend he has (Elmer. Duh. :smile:) and get the help he needs. 

It's a weird premise, but a fun enough book. The mathematical problem solving (and oh so prescient packing) comes to a head here, but it's just as fun as ever to read in the time. 

It's the weakest of the bunch, but a decent end to the series.
