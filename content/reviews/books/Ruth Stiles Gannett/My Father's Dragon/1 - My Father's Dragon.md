title: My Father's Dragon
---
It's a cute story, good for children.

A story about the narrator's father's adventures, gone fantastic. There are talking animals and a dragon and it's never really clear how much if any of this might have happened... but in the end, does it matter?

It's cute and teaches kids how to solve problems, make new friends, and rescue dragons. All lessons worth learning.
