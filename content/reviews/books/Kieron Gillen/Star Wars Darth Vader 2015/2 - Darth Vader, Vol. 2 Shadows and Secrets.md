More Vader! More Aphra!  

More... trouble?  

<!--more-->

Vader actually seems to care about Aphra for reasons I haven't quite figured out yet (and I could totally be projecting that on him), but combine that with the idea that he's still not back into the Emperor's good graces... well, Vader has something of a mess on his hands.

You're not wrong.  

It's a fascinating story. Onwards!  

Side note: Man, I love Triple-Zero.

Unabashedly evil characters can be fascinating to read when done well. Especially when they have a *reason* to be so evil (even if that reason isn't much more than 'insane and torture-loving').
