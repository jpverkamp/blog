Okay. We're heading towards the conclusion of this particular story arc. I really do like this length. 4 volumes has about as much oomph as a novel length story, albeit with a much higher concentration of pretty* pictures.  

With that being said, Vader is making his way back into Palpatine's good (bad?) graces--but he now truly understands how the Sith work.

On the way there, we have more discussions about man versus machine:

Some even crazier cybernetically enhanced set pieces/battle scenes:

And of course... more Triple-Zero.

Delightful.  

Centering a story around the bad guy (well before his redemption arc in this case, although there are hints even now with Dr. Aphra) is an interesting choice. I greatly enjoyed it, but this is also a good length. There's only so long you can cheer for the side of wanton terror, death, and destruction...
