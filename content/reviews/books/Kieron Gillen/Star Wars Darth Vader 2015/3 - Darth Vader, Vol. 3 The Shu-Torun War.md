Okay, now this went a bit sideways. Forget the Emperor and politicking (more or less). Instead, get thrown into a rivalry on a mining planet that's obsessed with etiquette...

...and watch how Vader deals with the whole mess. Yeah. You can probably guess how well that goes for Vader. And how ... less well for everyone else.  

One plot point that I haven't really mentioned is the introduction of a small pile of cybernetically enhanced pseudo-Jedi/Sith. They can fight with lightsabers, but don't really do the force thing. And it's hinted at least that they're potential rivals for Vader's position as Sith apprentice.  

It's a fascinating parallel, especially given how Vader is as much if not more machine than man... and still a terrifyingly powerful Force user despite/because of it.

I'm ... not sure exactly what to think about that. From the prequels, we have midichlorians--an answer to a question that probably shouldn't have been answered about how the force works. And Triple-Zero (in his wonderfully creepy way) is right--it's about blood. Living blood. There's something interesting there.  

Quite a story. Onwards to the conclusion!  

Oh right. Triple-Zero remains homicidally delightful.
