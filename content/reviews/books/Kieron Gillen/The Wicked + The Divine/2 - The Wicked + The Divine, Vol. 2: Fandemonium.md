A fiery start and an even more bonkers escalation. I love the idea behind the worlds so much, especially as we learn more. The art is fantastic, especially that party scene. Pages and pages odd of colors. 

Onward!

Pages and pages of dance party yo.

That’s a fascinating idea. I might just have to steal it.
