Well that's a wonderful start.

Worldbuilding: 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/wicked-divine-1-018a58.png)

Gods as rockstars. A flash of brilliance and they're gone.

> It's better to burn out than to fade away.

I do love the analogy.

Especially in a world where they do appear to have some magic after all.

Characters:

Luci and Laura. Laura is a great everyman, Luci is probably my favorite of the Gods.

The Morrigan. The Triple Goddess. I like this interpretation.

Art:

It's beautiful. Vibrant colors mixed with the {{<wikipedia halftones>}} of traditional comics.

Worth a read so far!
