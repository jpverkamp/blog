Crossover!

With Doctor Aphra… and Black Krrsantan? (And the droids of course). 

That certainly has potential! Force Vampires! (of course that’s a thing) The titular “Screaming Citadel”—delightfully Gothic. Mind control brain crabs. It’s got it all!

It’s a little ridiculous at times and leans *far* more into the fantasy side of Star Wars, but I enjoyed it.

I do enjoy seeing more of Doctor Aphra. Especially with Luke so… trusting.

I should go check out the Doctor Aphra series at some point!

Side note, I loved this panel:

Oh Triple Zero. Such a fun dark C-3PO.
