Well...

What if what could happen were more akin to a forced vacation? Stranded alone on a world with a strict isolationist policy. No transmitters. No traffic in or out other than every six months. 

It's a neat story. Interesting to see which of our heroes adapts to the quiet life... and which very much do not. 

Plus, hints of the wider Star Wars universe. Lightsaber proof shields. Massive beasties to hunt--in defense of the town. A Jedi in love. And maybe a way away from all that war...

A good one.
