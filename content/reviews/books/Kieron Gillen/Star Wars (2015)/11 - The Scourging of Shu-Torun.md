title: The Scourging of Shu-Torun
---

Princess Leia has a plan! Economic upset on a massive scale... and if it happens to come with revenge against a certain recent traitor to the Rebellion? All the better.  

What could go wrong?

(It's even better, as Luke was just looking for them...)

It’s quite cinematic. Fetch quests, exotic locales, a crazy multipliprong battle with stakes both huge and personal…

I quite enjoyed this one.

Side note, this reminded me of the Ember Island Players / the opening of Thor Ragnarok in all the best ways.

Also, a very Han line.

They do the dialogue surprisingly well in these I think.
