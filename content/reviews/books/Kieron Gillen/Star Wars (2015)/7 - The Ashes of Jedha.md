It’s quite the story. A shattered planet with a truly giant hole down to the mantle. Another Force cult. (When you stare into the abyss…) Some new Imperial baddies. 

This one has it all. 

Got away from the series for a bit. This was a great place to pick it back up!

Onward.

Side notes (minor spoilers):

I looked it up. When they first met, Leia was 19 and Han is 10-15 years older. That’s… a bit much (especially at that age). Although about the same as the difference in the actors’ ages. So I guess there is that.

This is such an odd art style.

I love that line.
