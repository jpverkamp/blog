I find Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies endlessly fascinating. They hit a number of my personal interests, in particular low cryptography and level network protocols/data formats. I'm generally familiar with how blockchains work in general and have actually played a bit with demo implementations of the same technology. That being said, there are a lot of details on the business and variety between different technologies that I find less than knowledgeable about.

Hmm.

Hmmmmm.

Right. So this was not the book I thought it was. It was still fascinating. The first part gives a pretty solid perspective on a few common crytocurrencies, although I'm not sure if it would be as easy to understand if you hadn't already understood them decently already. And then the entire rest of the book is instead focused to help you _investigate crimes involving cryptocurrencies and other blockchain technologies_. Fascinating reading. Not something I'm currently interested in at the moment.  

A solid enough book, probably more useful for someone other than me. So it goes.  

Random aside:  

> I often see this attitude amongst investigators when it comes to anything that obfuscates computer communication or hides data. When investigating a computer with a VPN client on it, if storage encryption is turned on, a Tor client is installed, or even if a browser cache has been recently purged, the assumption is that the owner “must have something to hide.” I regularly argue that many reasons exist why someone would have all or any of these software tools on their computer—they may have something to hide, but it's not actually illegal or they just value their right to privacy. Sadly, I'm usually wrong, and the computer owner generally does have something bad to hide—but it's nice to think the best of people, isn't it?  

Sounds like me. I bet if anyone looked at my setup, I would look guilty as hell...
