Pride + Gluttony, Ed does what needs doing, and the oh so very creepy zombie attack of Fullmetal Alchemist. Man this story keeps getting crazier and crazier. It's fascinating to me to see how some loyalties shift from what you believed you knew and some just keep getting better/worse all the while.  

Per volume thoughts (potentially spoilery):  

<!--more-->

 **Chapter 88: The Understanding**

You know, it's totally true. And pretty badass of Ed to do what he did there.  

**Chapter 89: Soldiers' Return**

ICE CREAM! Every once in a while this story is just really surreal.  

**Chapter 90: Army of Immortals**

Youn women... That's kind of gross Van Hohenheim.  

**Chapter 91: A Reunion of Alchemists**  

![FMA-22-091-1-Pride-x-Kimblee](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-22-091-1-pride-x-kimblee.png)  

So matter of factly. Ate him. And Kimblee barely even bats an eye.  

![FMA-22-091-2-Elrics-be-crazy](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-22-091-2-elrics-be-crazy.png)  

The Elrics both be crazy, yo.  

![FMA-22-091-3-MAY-FIGHT-SCENE](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-22-091-3-may-fight-scene.png)  

MAY FIGHT SCENE!  

TINY. BUT. FIERCE.  

![FMA-22-091-4-SMOOT](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-22-091-4-smoot.png)  

SMOOT. That is all.  

**Volume 22: Extras**  

![FMA-22-x-PRIDE-ATE-GLUTTONY](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-22-x-pride-ate-gluttony.png)  

It kind of makes sense. Other than a few words, did anything really change when Pride ate Gluttony?
