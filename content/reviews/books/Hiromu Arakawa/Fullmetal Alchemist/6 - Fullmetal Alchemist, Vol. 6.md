A kindred spirit! The whole island sequence I love.  

**6.23: Knocking on Heaven's Door**

Teacher is a badass!  

And then the backstory just took a turn for the really bizarre... The worldbuilding in this series is top notch and has just the right amount of strange to really intrigue me.  

**6.24: Fullmetal Alchemist**  

So that's how he got his name.

Interesting way to join the military.  

 **6.25: Master and Apprentice**

Oh the art style sometimes. And the weirdness of the backstory. So
