Ooooh my. A human traitor, a Homunculus rendered ... cute?, the fated meetings of Rose and Winry and Van Hohenheim and his children, a whole manufactored army (because of course) ... and the Armstrongs. Oh the Armstrongs. Things just keep escalating step by step. We're really getting into the endgame now!  

Potential spoilers:

 **Chapter 79: Bug Bite**  

![FMA-20-079-1-Kimblee-is-nuts](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-20-079-1-kimblee-is-nuts.png)  

Kimblee is ... quite the character. I do not understand his motivations. But man, for the most human of the villains... he's also perhaps the most terrible.  

**Chapter 80: The Prodigal Father Returns**  

![FMA-20-080-1-A-new-host](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-20-080-1-a-new-host.png)  

It's sort of cute! And now ... a perfect host?  

![FMA-20-080-2-Everyone-loves-Yoki](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-20-080-2-everyone-loves-yoki.png)  

Because everyone loves Yoki. I almost feel sorry for him. Almost.  

![FMA-20-080-3-Reverse-Cinderella](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-20-080-3-reverse-cinderella.png)  

So... they have Cinderella in this world? That was midly surprising. And the interpretation of 'reverse Cinderella` is actually quite amusing.  

![FMA-20-080-4-Whoa](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-20-080-4-whoa.png)  

Oh my. That got quickly terrifying.  

**Chapter 81: A Full Recovery**  

![FMA-20-081-1-Rose-and-Winry](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-20-081-1-rose-and-winry.png)  

Rose and Winry meet up! I ... have no idea what Rose's motivations are or if she'll stick around much, but I'm curious to see what's next for this.  

![FMA-20-081-2-POW-soul-soldiers](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-20-081-2-pow-soul-soldiers.png)  

And I didn't think it could get even worse.  

It got worse.  

**Chapter 82: Family by Spirit + Chapter 83: The Promised Day**  

One of these is very short.  

![FMA-20-082-1-Subtle](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-20-082-1-subtle.png)  

Subtle, Ed isn't.  

![FMA-20-082-2-CONFLICT](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-20-082-2-conflict.png)  

THIS CHARACTER HAS CONFLICT. WE HAVE TO MAKE IT OBVIOUS BY YELLING.  

More seriously, the Lin/  

![FMA-20-082-3-Armstrongs](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-20-082-3-armstrongs.png)  

The Armstrongs are such a weird complicated family. And so very shiny.  

![FMA-20-082-4-I-m-a-housewife](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-20-082-4-i-m-a-housewife.png)  

... she's so crazy. It's awesome. But crazy.  

**Volume 20 Extras**  

![FMA-20-x-Big-Booty-Alchemist](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-20-x-big-booty-alchemist.png)  

I just had to share this. For much the same reason the author had to in the extras.
