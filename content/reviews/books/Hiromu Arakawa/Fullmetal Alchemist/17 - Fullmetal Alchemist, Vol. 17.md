Man this story is getting crazy. Another Homunculus (Sloth!), a giant transmutation circle under the whole country, more Von Hoenheim backstory, something wicked in the tunnel...  

Man this series is good.

**Chapter 66: The Snow Queen**

Al's anime face is greatly amusing.  

![17-066-2-SHOOP-KATONG](/embeds/books/attachments/17-066-2-shoop-katong.png)  

SHOOP! KATONG! COMIC BOOK SOUNDS!  

![17-066-3-Sloth](/embeds/books/attachments/17-066-3-sloth.png)  

Sloth seems awfully hard working. Which I guess is the point?  

 **Chapter 67: Burgeoning Borders**  

![17-067-1-Horses](/embeds/books/attachments/17-067-1-horses.png)  

Those poor horses. Imagine being lowered down into a dark tunnel beneath the whole country with no idea what to expect. Pretty crazy.  

![17-067-2-Armstrong](/embeds/books/attachments/17-067-2-armstrong.png)  

I thought Strongarm Alchemist Armstrong was the best Armstrong, but Major General Armstrong is really growing on me. She's awfully snarky.  

![17-067-3-ZU-GUK](/embeds/books/attachments/17-067-3-zu-guk.png)  

ZU GUK. But what is he doing?!  

 **Chapter 68: Portrait of a Family**  

![17-068-1-Von-Hohenheim](/embeds/books/attachments/17-068-1-von-hohenheim.png)  

Man the backstory fo Von Hohenheim is getting so crazy. What in the world is he? What's going on there? A proto Homonculus? But he had children of his own? And Ed and Al's mother knew?!  

![17-068-2-Eep](/embeds/books/attachments/17-068-2-eep.png)  

Man some of the beasties in this series are terrifying. The terror of the darkness come alive...  

 **Chapter 69: The Foundation of Briggs**  

![17-069-1-Shame-if-something-were-to-happen](/embeds/books/attachments/17-069-1-shame-if-something-were-to-happen.png)  

Be a shame if something were to happen to them... Man FPKBWrath is intense.
