We're learning so many more things about the world! And it's getting bigger and crazier and more wonderful all the time.  

**30: The Truth Inside the Armor**

ðŸ¦‘ Al knows now! ðŸ¦‘

![FMA-8-30-Barry](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-8-30-barry.png)  

You know, I didn't expect Barry to stick around after his first scene. Nor to actually start rooting for him, serial killer and all.  

![FMA-8-30-Stay-dead](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-8-30-stay-dead.png)  

FPK Bradley being  {{< spoiler >}}Wrath{{< /spoiler >}}  makes this all the more sensible.  

**31: The Snake That Eats Its Own Tail**  

![FMA-8-31-Barry](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-8-31-barry.png)  

More Barry!  

**32: Emissary From the East**  

More worldbuilding! There's a far east! Also, ADORABLE!

And FPK Bradley... has kids? How's that work?  {{< spoiler >}}Homunculi can have kids?{{< /spoiler >}}

**33: Showdown in Rush Valley**  

![FMA-8-33-BOING-BOING](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-8-33-boing-boing.png)  

BOING BOING BOING! Another wild zany character. I think I like him? I think the 'I think' is the entire point of the thing?

OOâ„²  

**Bonus Chapter: Fullmetal Alchemist and the Broken Angel**

... that's Al. Heh.
