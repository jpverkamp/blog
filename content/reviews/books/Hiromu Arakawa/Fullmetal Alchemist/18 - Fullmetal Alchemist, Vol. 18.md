Hooooly crap. Another Homunculos: Pride. And not at all who I would have expected! Crazy chimera fight (those are still a thing, remember?) and a bit more development and growth from May.  

Onwards!  

<!--more-->

 **Chapter 70: The First Homunculus**

So LUVY.

It's cute. I wonder if that will be resolved in this series. Things seem to be moving too fast / they're a bit young for that. But they've been through a lot.

PRIDE and joy eh? I caught that reading through, but I was totally joking... and then a page or two later...  

 **Chapter 71: In the Grip of the Red Lotus**

It's funny because acknowledge sexism? Flipping to an absolute badass just to gain the respect of those around you as a woman is still sexism.  

**Chapter 72: A Chain of Negativity, A Pebble of Goodness**  

![18-072-1-SPIT-FIGHT](/embeds/books/attachments/18-072-1-spit-fight.png)  

SPIT FIGHT GO!

IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE HE'S METAL!  

These chapters with big fight scenes are crazy fun. I want to watch the series (plural) again.  

**Chapter 73: A Daydream**  

![18-073-1-24-hours-she-cares](/embeds/books/attachments/18-073-1-24-hours-she-cares.png)  

Aw. Major General Armstrong is a hardass and all about survival of the fittest on paper. But she truly cares about her people. I liked this scene.  

![18-073-2-May-grows](/embeds/books/attachments/18-073-2-may-grows.png)  

How old is May supposed to be? All this way to save her people--and coming to the realization that it may not be worth the cost. That's a lesson some never do learn.
