These books are wonderful.  

**26: To Meet the Master**  

<!--more-->

The world gets a few steps weirder. Not only suits of armor with nobody inside them[^inside][^yet], but now we have human/animal hybrids as well!  

![FMA-7-26-Stretch](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-7-26-stretch.png)  

So... How does Al see? He doesn't have eyes. Or a brain. The whole idea of souls bound to armor is ... weird. For that matter, how much does he weigh?  

**27: The Beasts of Dublith**  

On one hand:  

![FMA-7-27-Greed](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-7-27-greed.png)  

GREED! We're still missing Sloth (although we've had references), Wrath (soon!), and Pride.  

The best part of the chapter though? Teacher.

Man she's awesome.

Also comic book sounds:

**28: A Fool's Courage**  

Strongarm Alchemist Armstrong is so ridiculous. And awesome. And now there are two of them...

**29: The Eye of the King**  

![FMA-7-29-Oroborus](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-7-29-oroborus.png)  

{{< spoiler >}}FPK BRADLEY IS WRATH! HOLY CRAP{{< /spoiler >}}  

If that was a plot point in the anime, I totally don't remember it (it's been years). It all makes so much sense now.  

On a more comic books soundsy note:

**Bonus Chapter: The Second Lieutenant Goes to Battle!**  

![FMA-7-x-Armstrong-family](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-7-x-armstrong-family.png)  

Strongarm Alchemist Armstrong is so ridiculous... but I'm certainly not going to be the one to tell him that.  

[^inside]: Dr Seuss' Pale Green Pants for inspiration?!  

[^yet]: Not yet anyways! The whole sequence with someone trapped inside Al was hilarious and weird.
