Hoo boy. That was yet another crazy volume. I seem to be saying that a lot, but man. Father. Answers. Questions. Alchemy on a whole 'nother scale. Gross and weird and crazy homunculi.  

Onward!

 **Chapter 54: The Fool's Struggle**  

Man this was a crazy chapter.

An interesting point of view from Father:

EYE BALLS!

 **Chapter 55: The Avarice of Two**  

I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON, BUT IT'S INTERESTING!

Also, I'm getting some strong {{< goodreads book="Elantris" >}} vibes from the non-locals still being able to use Alchemy. That's interesting.  

**Chapter 56: The Lion of the Round Table**  

Sometimes, you remember that Al is still just a kid.

And sometimes... in the most meta way possible.  

**Chapter 57: Scars of Ishval**  

And finally...

That. Man Father is weird. So many answers. So many more questions...
