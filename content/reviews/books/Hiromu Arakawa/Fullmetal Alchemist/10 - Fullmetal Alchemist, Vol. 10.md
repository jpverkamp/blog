The worldbuilding continues to expand. We're getting some really interesting thoughts on what exactly the difference is between bodies and souls... and what it means to separate them. Also more on how homunculi work and how to finally kill them.  

Oy these are crazy.

**Chapter 38: Signal to Strike**

Makes sense. And could be useful for the Elric brothers!  

 **Chapter 39: Complications at Central**

SHLA-MUK! Oh Gluttony is so gross.  

![FMA-10-39b-IMMORTAL](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-10-39b-immortal.png)  

But ... useful for those seeking immortality I guess?

Oh Barry...  

![FMA-10-39d-And-he-cannot-lie](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-10-39d-and-he-cannot-lie.png)  

And he ... cannot lie? Every once in a while, the translations seem amusingly juvenile.  

![FMA-10-39e-Tough-to-kill](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-10-39e-tough-to-kill.png)  

... wow homunculi are hard to kill.  

**Chapter 40: Philosopher from the West**  

![FMA-10-40a-Lets-do-it](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-10-40a-lets-do-it.png)  

Heh! LET'S DO IT!  

![FMA-10-40b-Made-of-metal](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-10-40b-made-of-metal.png)  

Ouch. I hadn't considered that. I wonder what sort of metal he's made out of.  

Also... what in the world did they do that cost an entire country...  

 **Chapter 41: On the Palm of an Arrogant Human Being**  

![FMA-10-41a-Oh-Barry](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-10-41a-oh-barry.png)  

Oh Barry.  

![FMA-10-41b-Cutting-corners](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-10-41b-cutting-corners.png)  

Quite a place to be cutting corners. I knew there was something up about that from the start though.  

![FMA-10-41c-The-one-with-the-boobs](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-10-41c-the-one-with-the-boobs.png)  

Again with the boobs. It feels real enough, but it's still funny.

SCAR!!!
