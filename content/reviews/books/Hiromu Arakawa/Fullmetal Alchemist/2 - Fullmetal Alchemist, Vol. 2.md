We're starting to get hints at just how horrifying the world of Fullmetal Alchemist can be, from--well, the above, to someone that figure out how to transmute people into little bitty bits and then another that merged his daughter and dog together. Oy. Just oy.  

Wonderful story, in a sometimes gritty and violent sort of way. Worth the read.
