> I'm going first

Right in the feels. :(  

<!--more-->

Man these stories get crazy at times. Winy and Ed are reunited in a wonderfully violent way, Van Hohenheim realizes he was a terrible father, Gluttony is wonderfully creepy (all the Homunculi are), more and more people are learning the truth and picking sides. It just keeps building and building. Only a few more volumes left!  

AHHHH!  

Spoilers etc:  

 **Chapter 84: Shadow of the Pursuer**

Well... that's a thing. Aren't they teenagers?  

![FMA-21-084-1-Pure-intentions](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-21-084-1-pure-intentions.png)  

Heh. I love her reaction though!  

 **Chapter 85: The Empty Box**  

> I'm going first

Right in the feels. :(

Major General Armstrong is an odd one...

Oh Van Hohenheim.  

Also as a random note, Ed makes clothes seemingly without effort. How do any industries survive with alchemists around? I guess there arenâ€™t that many of them? I guess you'd need skilled alchemists willing to make clothes for a living?  

**Chapter 86: Servant of Darkness**  

![FMA-21-086-1-Gluttony](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-21-086-1-gluttony.png)  

Gluttony is my favorite. Not as a good person (heh), but just as a fascinating character. He's not deep, but he's so wonderfully creepy.  

**Chapter 87: An Oath Made in the Underground**  

![FMA-21-087-1-Selim](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-21-087-1-selim.png)  

Speaking of creepy... how did Selim remain hidden so long? I guess people just don't look for things that they don't expect to see?  

![FMA-21-087-2-Christmas](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-21-087-2-christmas.png)  

That was a fun twist.  

Also: Flash bangs against Pride's shadow arms is BRILLIANT! And PRIDE ATE GLUTTONY. Oh my. Each time I think I know the worst that could happen...
