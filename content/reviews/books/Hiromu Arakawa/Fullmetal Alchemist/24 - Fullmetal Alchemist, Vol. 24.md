Onward!  

Man these books are ramping up for the conclusion. And there are still a handful of volumes left!  

<!--more-->

I think the one problem with the manga format is that long fight scenes really start to lose focus. Entire volumes of nothing but fighting are ... hard to read. Still worth it though.  

Random thing that blew my mind:  

> [Paracelsus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracelsus) (/ˌpærəˈsɛlsəs/; 1493/1494[1] – 24 September 1541), born Theophrastus von Hohenheim (full name Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim[10]), was a Swiss physician, alchemist, lay theologian, and philosopher of the German Renaissance.  

There's not really much to say at this point. If you've read this far, you're going to finish it. So just a few awesome scenes. Warning, potential spoilers.  

 **Chapter 96: Two Strong Women**

Man Sloth just keeps going...  

![FMA-24-096-2-Watch-out-Izumi](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-24-096-2-watch-out-izumi.png)  

Heh. Strongarm Alchemist Armstrong is wonderful. Watch out Izumi!  

![FMA-24-096-3-A-housewife-and-an-alchemist](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-24-096-3-a-housewife-and-an-alchemist.png)  

She's a housewife AND an alchemist. It's a minor plot, but I really feel it coming to a head here.  

![FMA-24-096-4-Sins-make-us-human](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-24-096-4-sins-make-us-human.png)  

It's true you know. It's not only our virtues that make us human... but also the terrible things we can do and that we fight against.  

 **Chapter 97: The Two Philosophers**  

![FMA-24-097-1-Madness](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-24-097-1-madness.png)  

... that way lies madness. But it does explain a bit about why he seems so distance.  

![FMA-24-097-2-Woman-power](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-24-097-2-woman-power.png)  

Woman power! Izumi and Major General Armstrong are pretty badass. And an interesting contrast against one another.  

![FMA-24-097-2-ZU-ZU-ZU-ZU](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-24-097-2-zu-zu-zu-zu.png)  

ZU ZU ZU... Father is bizarre. It's interesting how much it's form and Pride's look the same.  

**Chapter 98: Greed Without Limits**  

![FMA-24-098-1-Ab-block](/embeds/books/attachments/fma-24-098-1-ab-block.png)  

... he blocked a sword with his abs. That is all.  

**Chapter 99: Eternal Rest**  

Man these fights are getting crazier and crazier. Crazy fight time. Suicide bomber (failed). Stabbed (succeeded).  

And then ... I’m not sure what even happened. Oh no teacher!!
