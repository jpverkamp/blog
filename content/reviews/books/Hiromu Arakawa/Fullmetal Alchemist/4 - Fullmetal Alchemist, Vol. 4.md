I only half remember the anime, which apparently diverges at some point anyways. So it's a combination of half remembered things and being surprised over and over again. Imagine, being saved by Lust/Envy/Gluttony et al -- knowing that there's far more to them, but not exactly what. It's crazy.  

A few random lovely scenes?

What happened? Strongarm happened.

Fist bump!  

It is lovely to see the brothers talk things out. They have such a bond... and have been through so much. I like seeing that. They fight like brothers would, but their relationship is not only that... as it should be.

BLOOM

Dog training...  

Also, the author has quite the sense of humor. And a thing for cows it seems?

You know, I don't think I'd mind.
