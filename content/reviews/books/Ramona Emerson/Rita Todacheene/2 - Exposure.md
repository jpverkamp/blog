Of course I had to read the sequel!

It's another story of Rita Todacheene, but this time getting into the absolute *trauma* of the first book.

It's hard enough (I imagine) being a crime scene photography. Constantly exposed to all that fairly grisly death. But add to that ghosts only you can see screaming at you about solving their murders, but when few enough of your coworkers and bosses believe you--to the point of thinking you've lost your mind? 

Oy.

So Rita is done. Heading back home. 

Except this time... the ghosts are coming with her. 

This time, rather than backstory the second plot being Rita's past, we have another point of view--who we quicly learn is a serial killer caught up in his own paranoid worldview and bringing it violently to those around him. It's a fascinating contrast to the first book and I really liked it. It reminded me a lot of various thrillers I read years and years ago, mostly by [[Dean Koontz]](). 

Overall, it's a solid sequel and I so wish the best and better for Rita. Oh I'm curious to see if there will be another! Where do you go from here?
