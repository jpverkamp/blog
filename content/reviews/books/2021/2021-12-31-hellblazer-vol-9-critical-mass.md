{{< goodreads book="Hellblazer, Vol. 9: Critical Mass" cover="true" >}}

Two big stories, a few really trippy dreams, and Constantine managing to push off damnation a bit longer. A neat collection. Critical Mass in particular is worth the read. 

Mini reviews (spoilers):

## In Another Part of Hell

Chas’ mother… quite a figure. 

## Warped Notions 
### Part One: The Delicate Power of Terror 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-9-dd2f76.png)

Allllll right then. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-9-4fbb28.png)

Same thing. 

### Part Two: The Everything Virus

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-9-c29dfe.png)

They’re really going into the weird this time around…

### Part Three: The Shout

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-9-df879b.png)

He’s figuring it out!

### Part Four: Mountain of Madness

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-9-15d194.png)

Hard to argue with a dead man… Unless of course you’re in Constantine’s world. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-9-c5f93c.png)

That’s a neat trick!

## Dreamtime

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-9-3a7f37.png)

Ah. Another one of those. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-9-3c7979.png)

Double ah. Actually… one of those. I’m not sure how this is supposed to be terribly less problematic than the attitudes in the story itself. 

## Dangerous Ground

… oh Constantine. 

A bit of a come come back/improvement from the first half. I wonder if we’ll actually see any repercussions from that. 

## Riding the Green Lanes
Cursive in comics is really cool looking… but man it’s hard to read sometimes. 

A quick ghost story. Nothing more. 

## Critical amass
### Part One: Bait

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-9-3ec42c.png)

This one has potential. 

And yet, nothing seems off limits.

### Part Two: Troubled Waters

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-9-65a30f.png)

And now Constantine has to find one better…

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-9-4461b9.png)

Or answers at least. Neat concept. 

### Part Three: The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-9-3eb8d9.png)

A way out the same way he got into this mess? The same tricks twice? Might just work…

### Part Four: Coming up for Air

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-9-02ecc4.png)

### Part Five: Hook, Line, & Sinker 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-9-e9029b.png)

So that’s what he was doing. Neat trick. How in the world did he pull it off though?

And yet at the end:

That is a story I want yet.
