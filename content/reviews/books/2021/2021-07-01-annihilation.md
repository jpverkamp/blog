Now that is a fascinating sort of book. It's essentially a slice of life mixed with cosmic horror. The entire story follows an expedition into the mysterious, alien Area X. There's not really any overarching plot, other than exploring and perhaps surviving... and maybe if you're really really lucky, coming back without going mad.

If you go in wanting answers--or even to some extent, questions--then you're going to be disappointed. If you just want to hang on for a quick, creepy exploration into something just past the edge of otherworldly, this is a wonderful ride for it.  

One of the most interesting parts for me was the complete lack of names for any of the characters. They're always referred to by their jobs.

I have a problem with names sometimes, even in my own writing. I find myself writing that way, referring to people by traits or jobs rather than names. I never really realized how disorienting it can get when taking to the extreme. This novel... certainly showed me that.  

I guess in a nutshell, it's a fascinating work and I'm glad I read it. It's somewhat a niche book and I expect people are going to react strongly to it one way or another. It's certainly an odd book.  

I have no idea where a sequel could go, but you know what? Let's give it a try!
