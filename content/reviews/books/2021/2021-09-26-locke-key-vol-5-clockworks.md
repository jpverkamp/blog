Another volume, another Key. This time, the ability to travel in time! Albeit only to view what's going on. But given how many mysteries there are in this house and this family... that's more than enough.  

It's really interesting going back to the time of the Revolutionary War and the origins of the Locke family and the keys.

It's horrifying:

Not to mention downright Lovecraftian. With the town name we all know it was coming... but it's fascinating to see it confirmed.
