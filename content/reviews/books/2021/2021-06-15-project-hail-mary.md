Oh that's a wonderful book. If your read and enjoyed {{< goodreads book="The Martian" text=" The Martian " >}} , you'll almost certainly love {{< goodreads book="Project Hail Mary" text=" Project Hail Mary " >}} . The sense of humor mixed with scientific/engineering problem solving is the main strength in both. Great fun.  

It's got a wonderful sense of humor:

And it's chockfull of random SCIENCE:

It only gets better from there.  

I think the most ambitious part of the story is that the core of the story (outside of admittedly common) flashbacks is set with only a very very limited cast (read: 1  {{< spoiler >}}at first{{< /spoiler >}}  ) a long long way from any sort of help. It worked for the Martian, so let's do it again! And it really works here.  

What really shines to me though gets a bit into (what I consider minor) spoiler territory. Since it turns out:  {{< spoiler >}}our main character isn't alone after all, there's a very alien alien out there with him, trying to solve the same problem{{< /spoiler >}}  . Which leads to even more humor and SCIENCE, even better than the first part.  

And the best part yet: it's *positive*. Absolutely terrible things are happening/do happen throughout the book, don't get me wrong, but there's always a feel of 'we can fix this', which I hadn't realized how much I love in Sci Fi. Up through the very ending--I don't know if I would have made the same choices, but it really works for the book.  

Overall, one of my favorite books this year (if not ever). Makes me want to re-read The Martian!
