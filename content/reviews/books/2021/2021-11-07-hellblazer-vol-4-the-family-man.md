Better than Volume 3 by a long shot. Starts weird but interesting and gets better from there. I’ll reiterate though that I can’t really imagine buying these by issue, especially in real time. A volume has enough meat to it to sustain a storyline.

## Larger than Life

This has potential! Certainly starting the weird a bit quicker.

An interesting mix of mythologies. Given the nature of world building, it could very well be Cerberus or just named therefore. 

An interesting and bizarre story. I wonder if it’s stand alone?

Lovely. 

## The Family Man

Uh huh. I think you might be there. 

Also a reminder that while Constantine might be a good sort when demons are concerned…

…he’s not exactly a perfect paragon of virtue. 

Then again, he ends up turning up something for more interesting.

## Early Warning

They could very well be speaking literally (magitech is fascinating) or figuratively and I’d not know enough about this world to guess. I know demons are real, we’ve seen them. But do **they** know that?

Well…

A little of both and a bit of neither it seems. 

That’s what makes for interesting reading!

## How I Learned to Love the Bomb

Well that got delightfully dark. 

Especially when:

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-4-ea009e.png)

Oh! The plot thickens. 

That’s a pretty cool story line. 

## Hold Me

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-4-947625.png)

Weird/different art style and a weird start to the plot (again with the sperm donation? Constantine comments on that :) but once we get to the smelly man things get **properly** weird. And then it’s over…

## Thicker than Water

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-4-0a037f.png)

Well that’s a start. At least it’s more colorful? It’s nice (for some definitions thereof) to get back to the Family Man plot. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-4-4a2c3a.png)

Of course that’s a thing. 

## Sick at Heart

And then it was personal. I didn’t put that together last time…

## Fatality
Confrontation! Motivation! And to some extent it all started with a later date night. Granted, there had to be underlying problems, but that is still perfectly mundane. 

I didn’t realize how relatively early in his career this would be for Constantine. 

## Mourning of the Magician
A callback to Gemma and the ghost wives! Nice follow up. Been a bit. 

And dealing with his dad on top of it. A way of letting go. 

Voodoo arrested via formaldehyde amuses me somewhat. 

## New Tricks

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-4-fe72a6.png)

That’s a villain. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-4-92f765.png)

Heh. Seriously? That worked?

## Sundays are Different

And so it ends.
