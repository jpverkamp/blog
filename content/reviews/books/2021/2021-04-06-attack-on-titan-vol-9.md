So. Just when we know who the female Titan is, there's a new one stomping about: the Beast Titan. And somehow another wall has fallen. I have no idea what's the root at all this... but they don't either, so off to find out!  

Man the twists in this series. I think at some point, the biggest twist is going to be paying it straight and everyone will be so surprised!

A few of my favorite scenes:

Inspirational speaches!

A new, weird fuzzy Titan. That can ... talk!

Sick of not knowing what's going on? It's easier when Titans aren't trying to eat me, but I toitally get it...  

And then finally:
