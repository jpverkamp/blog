{{< goodreads book="Clockwork Princess" cover="true" >}}

I'll admit, I was perhaps a little hard on {{< goodreads book="Clockwork Angel" text=" Clockwork Angel " >}} / {{< goodreads book="Clockwork Prince" text=" Clockwork Prince " >}} . But {{< goodreads book="Clockwork Princess" text=" Clockwork Princess " >}} is quite a bit better.  

In one book, we have big battles, a conclusion to the automaton plotline, an actual resolution to the love triangle (I'll come back to this), more politics, and answers for just what Tessa actually is and what that means for the greater universe. I can't really think of anything in particular that I particularly would have wanted that was missing.

Still rather more love triangle that I like in my urban fantasy, but by far my favorite of the trilogy. On to something else now!  

**Spoilers** :  

So. The Tessa/Jem/Will love triangle. It was something of a mess, especially given that everyone involved is still a teen. Like I've said before, perhaps it's just not for me. But if you leave aside that, I did _not_ expect the resolution to be  {{< spoiler >}}Jem dying, but not really so that Tessa can end up with Will{{< /spoiler >}}  . Even if it eventually got backtracked, it really works. And in the end,  {{< spoiler >}}because of immortality, she can have her Will and then later Jem too, in a decent enough conclusion{{< /spoiler >}}  . So. That was most certainly a thing. I really appreciate what Cassandra Clare did with all that, even if it's not the sort of think I seek out.
