A more or less standard medieval fantasy world with one exception: necromancy is well known and fairly widely practiced; although at least recently they're hated and discriminated against, to the point of mostly living in their own section of the kingdom. It's straight forward enough worldbuilding, and I like the basic idea. Necromancers are almost always the bad guys, so turning it around and having them being a decent bunch of people being suppressed is an interesting way to do it.  

Other than that, there's one really odd bit of worldbuilding: one main character who happens to have the ability to control fire and wind. Who's apparently only born once a generation (or less) and doesn't fit at all with the rest of the world. In my opinion, it just doesn't fit.  

Characterwise, having a down on his luck, always failing at everything--until suddenly he's the best at everything--is common enough. He's a bit depressing, but I think it works. The mentor figure is pretty solid (and having them die off  {{< spoiler >}}but not really{{< /spoiler >}}  is pretty much a trope, but that's not a problem).  

The bad guy is... pretty over the top. He feels 'real' enough, twisted by his upbringing into an almost comically evil baddie who  {{< spoiler >}}makes use of the forbidden magic{{< /spoiler >}}  . It's not new, but it works.  

I think the main weakness of the book is that it's self published and from time to time it shows. There are a number of things that a solid editor would probably have toned down:  

> It was a major port center for the Poro Sea. I remember reading that it had a population of 60% Necromancers, 30% witches, and 10% humans. The city that was calling my name was Nezura. A society with 95% Necromancers and 5% witches. It was located at the end of the dog-leg, practically on the opposite side of Orbavue.

Worldbuilding with too specific of numbers.  

> I don't have all vlarking night!

Random new swear words just for the sake of being different (especially when most other things don't have new names) feels really weird.  

> “Wait.” Megan grabbed my arm. “Before you leave, I just wanted to say it’s been great to know you. Here, take this slip; it’s my address. I can’t promise I’ll always be home because I’m on the road a lot, but feel free to drop by whenever you’d like. I know how hard it can be starting on your own like this.”  
> 
> “Thank you!” I jumped in her arms and squeezed so tightly that I thought I was never going to let go.  

People don't talk like that, especially when you just meet them.  

Also a few very sudden changes of scope. 1/3 of the way through the book, {{< spoiler >}}sudden dinosaur for free{{< /spoiler >}}  . Training montage in a paragraph. Etc.  

It's not the end of the world, just something to know going in.  

Overall, for self published it's pretty good. I'll keep an eye out for a sequel.
