White Sand has something of an odd story. It's the first novel Sanderson finished (and also the 7th, a complete rewrite), but in prose form was never published. You can get it if you ask him (I think signing up for the newsletter? It's been a few years) and I read it back in 2016.  

Now though, the same story has been actually published as a three volume set of graphic novels. Having gotten rather more into graphic novels over the last year, of course I had to give it a try, so here we go!

On the plus side, I greatly enjoyed the artstyle. It *feels* like a brilliantly lit desert world, awash with tans and earth tones. The contrast with the darksiders (Khriss especially) is fascinting and it's a joy to watch. I don't really have a mental picture when I read works, so having one provided doesn't jar against that as it does to some others, so I enjoyed seeing it.

Another shot later in the novel, when we see one of the cities in what is essentially an oasis:

I think my favorite part of the visualizations overall is actually Khriss. She's got a wonderfully distinct style, in the strong white and blues. Given her wider Cosmere implications, it's fascinating to having something to see for her:

That being said, adapting fairly directly to a graphic novel was perhaps not the strongest way to read Sanderson's work. We lose a lot of the characterizations and internal thoughts and feelings that we'd otherwise get in prose.  

On top of that, the core of what a lot of people love about Sanderson--his magic systems--is lost in this particular visual system. The threads of sand look cool, but they're just sort of brilliantly swooping around. There's not really a sense for how it works and what you can do with it that I love seeing in his books.  

We do still have hints at the strange worldbuilding of White Sand that I loved though, such as hints of gunpowder being developed on half the world while magic reigns (only) on the other:

All that being said, I still did enjoy this mostly at the very least for the novelty of it. I enjoy Sanderson enough that I will read pretty much anything with his name on it. :D
