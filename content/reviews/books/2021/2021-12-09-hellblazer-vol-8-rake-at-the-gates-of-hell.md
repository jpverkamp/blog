{{< goodreads book="Hellblazer, Vol. 8: Rake at the Gates of Hell" cover="true" >}}

There was a lot of potential in this episode, with two longer storylines--one the continuation of the angels/devil storyline we've been dealing with for a while. But unfortunately, outside of a few very cool/trippy visuals it was a surprisingly quiet volume. A lot of human trouble, not enough supernatural craziness. Less moping at least, but without a real transition (at least in my opinion). Not terrible, but certainly one of the weaker entries in the series. 

## Damnation’s Flame
That… was a very story. Which is saying something for Constantine. Papa Midnite, visions within visions, and The President, shot in the head, holding his brains in. Oh Hellblazer. 

### Brave New World

Heh. 

Something I hadn’t really realized: he’s smoking again. Unless this is earlier. I’d think a near death scare like only Constantine can get out of would be enough to quit…

Haven’t seen Papa Midnite in a while…

### Broadway the Hard Way

Not in Kansas any more.

… all right then. 

### Trail of Tears

A nightmare in his mind and not much better for his body. What has he gotten himself into this time…

Ah. It all begins to come together. 

### Hail to the Chief

Visions from within a witchwalking? It’s gone recursive!

And then it ended. I guess? Weird. 

## Act of Union

Kit in the Before Times as well. A bit bittersweet now… both for Kit and Brenden. Weird time for this story. 

## Confessions of an Irish Rebel

Ah. Now the flashback makes more sense. And Midnite even figures into it! Ish. 

## And the Crowd Goes Wild
Just think of it…

… all the crazy crap Constantine has pulled, from Chas’ perspective. 

## Rake at the Gate of Hell
### Part One

Now **that** is something happening!

Another old flame too: Ellen this time. 

### Part Two

An interesting thought. I would think that everyone does have a line for everything. But… sometimes it’s not practical to get to?

Anyways, we immediately get to this:

Things that crack me up, Constantine style. 

I’m mostly not interested in this spelling unfortunately, except the Hell politics. That, I find fascinating. 

### Part Three

Perhaps they had to spell it out for me in black and white… but it all makes sense now, glow everything fits together. 

### Part Four 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-8-1bd4b8.png)

Creepy much? Astra is … certainly an interesting side effect of Constantine’s rather extravagant life. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-8-298b83.png)

That poor Priest. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-8-5854d2.png)

An interesting point. 

### Part Five

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-8-a1ace2.png)

It does cement the timeline at least, but I still feel like I’m missing something. 

### Part Six

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-8-c0ac6a.png)

And then, after six parts, they finally meet!

And we finally get the secret that drove that Priest mad:

Some interesting thoughts their. God, capable of loneliness. The first creation. 

And then… the twist. The twist that makes it all worth it. And Death. Sudden. Forever?

## Heartland

I fully expect this to go well and everyone to live happily ever after… even after he got mistaken for a drug dealer and his kneecap(s) shot off. 

Overall… too human and not enough Constantine for me though.
