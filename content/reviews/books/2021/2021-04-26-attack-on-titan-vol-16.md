Man it just keeps getting crazier and crazier. On one hand, we have more and more human on human violence in a giant underground columns set piece, perfect for their vertical maneuvering equipment.

A crazy story that I have no idea where it's going to end up.

Memories are involved and turns out... racism has a legit basis in this world? That's ... a bit weird, but we'll see hwo it goes.
