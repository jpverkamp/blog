So close and yet so far. So many are dead, trying to (did they succeed after all) to take down the Beast Titan. And now they have a choice. Theoretically, they can steal one of the Titan's abilities and save one of their own...  

But who?

Man, it's getting intense ramping up to the last run of the story.

I guess it's true enough, but it's still a hard choice.

Man. That's kind of terrifying. I mean, they have Eren still, but even that shouldn't possibly be enough.

Whoa. So... there's so much more to the world than we'd heard about. I mean, we figured this. But getting it spelled out like this is crazy. How's it all work?

Oooh backstory. True? Myth? Interesting!
