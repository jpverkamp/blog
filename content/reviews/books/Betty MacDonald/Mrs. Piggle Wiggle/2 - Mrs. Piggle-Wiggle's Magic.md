title: Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's Magic
---
My thoughts for the series as a whole are on the review for [[Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle]](). Really, if I'd only read that book and this one, I don't know if I would have continued the series. 

In the first, we have fairly mundane and reasonable solutions to realistic childhood issues. In this one--straight out magic. I'm not a huge fan, especially with the tonal shift. But I do really like [[Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's Farm]]() and (perhaps surprisingly) [[Happy Birthday, Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle]](), so I'm glad I continued. 

That being said, this one does have some fun moments (the Tattletales, Lester the pig with his table manners), so it's not all bad!

* *The Thought-You-Saiders Cure* - I think my kids got the wrong idea out of this one... also, as someone with their own audio/sensory issues to start with, that cure sounds *terrible*. 
* *The Tattletale Cure* - Super magical. But the Tattletales sound cute, so we'll give it a pass
* *The Bad-Table-Manners Cure* - The idea of a pig teaching table manners? Magical. Ridiculous. I like it. 
* *The Interrupters* - This one's funny, since I've seen tech that does this. Take a directional microphone and speaker and play back someone's words a second after they speak. They'll stop talking super quick. 
* *The Heedless Breaker* - Sometimes children are careless. This one seems entirely too magical a fix for what might be an otherwise underlying problem.
* *The Never-Want-To-Go-To-Shooler* - I... don't think it works like that. At all.
* *The Waddle-I-Dooers* - At least it's somewhat less magical. A decent conclusion.
