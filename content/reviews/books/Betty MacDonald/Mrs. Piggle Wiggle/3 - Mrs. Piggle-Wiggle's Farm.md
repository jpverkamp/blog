title: Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's Farm
---
My thoughts for the series as a whole are on the review for [[Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle]]().

For ... reasons, Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle has moved out of town to a farm. Here, she takes the problem children and uses (farm style) household chores in order to help them be better. 

It actually really works--and is so much less likely than [[Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's Magic]]. I think this might actually be my favorite. It's weird, writing this out, to realize how relatively few stories this one had though.

* *The Not Truthful Cure* - Magical animals are somehow better than magical cures? 
* *The Pet Forgetter Cure* - I don't know if forgetting to feed a child is an entirely appropriate way to help them remember, but it feels like it'd work.
* *The Destructiveness Cure* - This is my favorite. I was always taking things apart and I have at least one kid that's the same. Sometimes that has consequences, but it's still a skill worth learning. 
* *The Fraidy-Cat Cure* - Again, I *get* overthinking/planning. This one is cute. 
* *The Can't Find It Cure* - 'Easily distracted'. I think that [[Happy Birthday, Mrs. Piggle Wiggle]] handles this one better, even if it is a magical pill in that case.
