Oh, that's a long book to read for a half a chapter a night (and not even every night). I enjoyed it, but I think I've been enjoying each book in the series a little less. 

The first book, the kids were brilliant and that was the core of the story. They could think their way out of any wacky mystery they get into. Here, we have Constance literally reading minds and Reynie with his sixth sense for danger. Sticky with his perfect memory, reading just ... everything in the house. Even Kate's magical bucket--nah, I still enjoy that one.

On the other hand, there was a lot of action and for the most part, the kids are still working their way out of trouble all by themselves--even when a rescue is under way--and I enjoyed that. The plot itself didn't go to quite as adventurous destinations as the first two, which I missed. 

I still do really enjoy the found family aspects of the story on all levels. The kids themselves are great together and there are some really humorous points. And they're extended family all together, especially with Mr. Benedict, I really did enjoy that. They do get quite the sense of closure towards the end. 

Although there's apparently a 4th and a prequel, I think it's time to move on to something else. 

Onward!
