Man those are long books. :smile: Enjoyable though. 

> May your adventures bring you closer together, even as they take you far away from home.

Kate is delightful, I like seeing her growing relationship with Milligan. Constance seems to becoming slightly psychic, albeit in a way that they brush off as being very aware of the world and good at pattern matching. Sticky is more self aware while still being a wonderful brain about it all. And Reynie is growing into a solid natural leader. He already had it coming, but it's still good to see. 

Plotwise, it's less contained than the first book. Rather than mostly taking place in one place, it's more of a kidnap/mysterious plot that ends up traveling a chunk of the world. It's a nice change of pace, even if it feels a little contrived to get the kids on their own again.

Otherwise (heh), I do like where the story is going and I really like seeing the children grow. I'm looking forward to where and what they can do next! And... apparently there's a [TV show?!](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11875316/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1). And it's rated decently? That's intriguing. Perhaps finish the series first. 

Onward!
