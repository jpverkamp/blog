I miss Stargate...

6 issues making what would have been a decent enough Season 3 opener… but I want so much more than that. What would it be like to have {{<spoiler>}}an Ancient {{</spoiler>}} on the crew?! So it goes. 

Overall, it has potential as a contusion but I wouldn’t really consider it necessary or even necessarily canon.

Particular thoughts as I was reading (spoilers):

## Issue #1

And so ends Season 2. The characters don’t look much like themselves.

I feel like the Ancients could have figured that out. Maybe they didn’t need to?

A comics clip show?

Ancients?

That’s why I read by volume…

## Issue #2

That’s amusing. 

Seems like a military rescue is a poor choice. 

## Issue #3

![](/embeds/books/attachments/stargate-universe-ba21db.png)

That’s a neat solution.

Miraculously opening up new areas of the ship (with help). Would have been an interesting Season 3.

Nice! How did they miss that…

## Issue #4

![](/embeds/books/attachments/stargate-universe-6e6855.png)

Logically. 

Having a non-ascended Ancient around for any length of time could be a fascinating story. I don’t expect this to last. 

## Issue #5

![](/embeds/books/attachments/stargate-universe-367b75.png)

… right. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/stargate-universe-e16550.png)

Wouldn’t make for much of a story, now would it?

Now that’s a trick. 

## Issue #6

Pew pew. Saved!
