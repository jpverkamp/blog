Rogue. Juggernaut. Sabertooth.

Good times. 

It’s another crazy action packed volume. I’m amazed at how much they’re fitting into these. Almost as amazed at how any of them are supposed to fit into those outfits…

In any case, Weapon X, S.H.I.E.L.D., what’s left of the Brotherhood, and a few new friends all together. Learning just what lines they’ll each be willing to cross…

Onward!

That’s cute.

A dark S.H.I.E.L.D. Because of course.

Well that’s certainly one excuse to draw her semi clothed all the time.

Heh. That’s one way to find out though!

Wife, seen before. Kid? Oh my.

Those outfits are so ridiculous. The men are scarcely any better, but seriously. For prisoners even?
