All the fallout and barely time to process. 

And now Jean is having hallucinations and Beast’s new flame is digging for secrets…

Quite a ride, setting up all sorts of what’s next. 

Also, sudden art shifts yo. I like the new one. Don't think that will ever stop being surprising. 

Onward.

Sudden art style changes!

Totally not what’s going on to Jean… right? … right?

Oooooh snap.
