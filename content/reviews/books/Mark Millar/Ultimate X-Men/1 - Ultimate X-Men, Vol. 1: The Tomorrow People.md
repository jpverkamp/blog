---
Getting the team together, sleeper agent Wolverine, love triangles, betrayal, mass murder, and the bluening of Beast. 

That is an awful lot to fit into a single volume…

The philosophical differences between Professor X and his X-Men versus Magneto and his Brotherhood is quite often at the core of these stories, so it’s no surprise to see it here. 

The only question is… what comes next?!

Onward!

Notes (spoilers):

Assemble! The team, certainly not the women‘a outfits… I’m not sure if the late 90s/early 2000s or comic style is more to blame. 

Also… Marvel Girl? I see why she often has just gone by Jean Gray.

Okay that being the very next panel is kind of great. You go Hank.

I haven’t often the the darker sides and history of Wolverine. But it totally makes sense. I wonder how they’ll go with it in this run long term.

Pissing off the mutant you just commented you don’t know how to kill… brilliant idea that.

Again, a page later. So they’re not complete idiots at least. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-x-men-v1-7a72bd.png)

Creepy.

Highbrow humor it ain’t… but I’ll admit. I chuckled. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-x-men-v1-aa606b.png)

How old is Wolverine supposed to be in this continuity? Still hundreds of years? Again, creepy.

![](/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-x-men-v1-8088f4.png)

Of course. Another rule of the X-Men. Beast be blue. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-x-men-v1-d6deba.png)

Also also questionable. Are we supposed to be siding with the X-Men? I suppose it’s better than the outright murder the other two sides seen hellbent on at the moment?
