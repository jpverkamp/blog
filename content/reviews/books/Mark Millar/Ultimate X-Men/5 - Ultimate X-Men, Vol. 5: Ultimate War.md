title: 'Ultimate X-Men, Vol. 5: Ultimate War'
---
Magneto is back and **mad**. The Brotherhood vs the Ultimates! The X-Men are nowhere to be found. At least not ent S.H.I.E.L.D.  

Probably for the best, given the various infighting and differences of opinion in each and every one of these groups. They really do their best to constantly shake up teams in comics, don’t they. 

One thing I never really had reason to consider before… you know what Captain America’s shield, Thor’s hammer, and Iron Man’s armor have in common?

They’re all made of metal…

Unfortunately for all the promises, surprisingly little actually happens. It will be interesting to see what’s next… but something more now would have been nice. 

Onward.

Notes. Spoilers.

Well that’s certainly a start.

… why is Iron Man juicy?

Why is the Hulk still alive and not locked away in some prison somewhere far from people in this continuity? He’s got quite the body count…

I guess he at least isn’t made of it dependent on anything metallic.

That is awfully optimistic on Cap’s part there.

Oh boy.
