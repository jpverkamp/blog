Oh, that's quite a story. 

I think that I really like the Marvel stories that take place a bit further from our own world--gives them a chance to really change things up. And multiple universes lets you have characters you know and love--and brutally murder them. Always a good time. 

Worth the read.

Writ a bit longer (very mild spoilers):

A Mad Max style apocalyptic future, ruled by Marvelâ€™s villains. 

Logan, old and worn. Something happened 50 years ago and he's refusing to fight.

Hawkeye, blind and perhaps a touch insane.

Genre awareness, always a fun aspect.

Hulk's descendants, ruling out West. Dinosaurs. Venom riding a T-Rex. 


Looking forward to seeing where this goes from here!
