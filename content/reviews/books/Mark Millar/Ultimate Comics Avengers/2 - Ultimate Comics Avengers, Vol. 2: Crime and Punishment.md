In the Ultimates universe, the Avengers are the team that takes the dirty jobs. 

Like, apparently, teaming up with the Punisher (temporarily) and a proto Hulk gang boss (not sure why) against Ghost Rider? 

That’s certainly a thing. 

It’s the kind of story where no one wins and I’m not really sure the point. 

Onward!

And ‘The Spider’.

So how do you kill whatever Ghost Rider is?

Well, I wouldn’t try fire…
