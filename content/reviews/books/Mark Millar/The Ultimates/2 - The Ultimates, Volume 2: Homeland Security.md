title: 'The Ultimates, Volume 2: Homeland Security'
---
The one where we process the fallout from the first volume. Hulk on a murderous rampage. Hank Pym’s domestic abuse. Hard topics and certainly worthy of discussion…

Just kidding. Invasion of the shape shifting Nazi aliens. 

As one does. 

It’s another intense story line and maybe actually shaking up a few things. I really am curious how they’ll continue to deal with Banner and Pym. Slowly I expect. But that works. 

Onward!


Also: The fact that in this continuity, Thor is thought  crazy is thoroughly amusing.

Notes (spoilers):

So he’s a creep and has always been. An interesting topic to dig into. I’m worried it’s going to get swept under the rug somehow.

Hawkeye and Black Widow to join the party! They don’t make much sense as Avengers/Ultimates, but S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents? Certainly.

The punk rock look worth hoop earrings is certainly a choice.

11, and the Chitauri made Hitler. That’s an interesting choice.

Wouldn’t be normal without a few hero on hero* fights. At least this time they’ve so far avoided areas prone to civilians?

Lol. The conspiracy theories were right…

Thor gets all the coolest scenes.

Captain America. Cold blooded murder (of an alien combatant) and lying (to save the day). He got up to speed with modern America pretty well I think.

It is interesting what has changed in 20 years. Captain America may be / have been frozen in the 40s… but Banner and the authors are still a product of the 90s / early 2000s.

… that’s hilarious. And probably practical.
