Letâ€™s get the team together! Iron Man! Bruce Banner! Thor? Nah. The Pyms!

And of courseâ€¦

Captain America!

Nowâ€¦ we just need someone to fightâ€¦

Thatâ€™s a solid opener. Enough with the meet and greet to know who is who (even if it does rely somewhat on previous superhero knowledge) and then let them fight. 

Iâ€™m looking forward to seeing where else they go from here!

(Side note: holy crap that last issue they threw in thereâ€”thatâ€™s really setting us up for some interesting story linesâ€¦)

Why yes. That is Captain America attempting to stop a hydrogen bomb carrying rocket byâ€¦ jumping aboard.

The Pymsâ€¦ doing the science thing.

Iron Man doing his own thing, showing off. Curious if it will be the healing factor Iron Man we saw a few volumes ago or if theyâ€™ve already scrapped (heh) that idea.

lol awesome. Especially when this comic came out in 2002â€¦ 6 years before the MCU Iron Man.

Not perfectly prescient after all them. Can you imagine Iron Depp?

â€¦ oh my.
