Oh, [[T. Kingfisher]]() is a lot of fun. 

> Smart goblins became mechanics. Dumb goblins became soldiers. Really dumb goblins became officers. 

It's this delightful little story about a world where Goblins are at war with the Humans and Elves. It's told from the point of view of a ragtag group of Goblins who suddenly find themselves *far* behind enemy lines, having to ally themselves with ... a veterinarian of all things. 

It's quite a funny book; the humor reminds me a lot of [[Discworld]]()--take that as the compliment it is. I love reading about all the goblins. They are most *certainly* a wacky bunch of characters[^characters]. 

> Wherever a goblin happens to live, he complains about it constantly. This is actually a sign of affection. A desert goblin will complain endlessly about the beastly heat and the dreadful dryness and the spiky cactus. He will show you how his sunburn is peeling and the place where the rattlesnake bit him and the place where he bit the rattlesnake. He will be thoroughly, cheerfully, miserable.

[^characters]: Both in the sense of character in a book and in the sense of wacky hijinks. 

Oh, and of course the teddy bear[^bear]!

> The bear not only had a set of stripes sewn on his arm, it was possibly the first teddy-bear in history to have received a medal for service to the elven nation.

And the contrast of an Elven veterinarian, getting into all the dirty, messy, ugly things vets have to do (when Elves normally only concern themselves with that which is fair beautiful and true) is great fun. 

[^bear]:  It makes sense in context. Sort of.

It's a quick read (147 pages) and well worth the fun. Give it a try!
