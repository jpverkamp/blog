Well that was a delightful surprise--in a dark fairytale kind of way. I've not read any T. Kingfisher before, but I'll have to remedy that. 

In a nutshell, Nettle & Bone takes the idea of a fairy godmother's blessing at birth and twists it, bringing in the politics of unequal neighboring kingdoms; fae, their bargains, and all the twists that go with that; and a touch of demons and death magic. It's a fun world to build a foundation on.

On top of that, it's a wonderful cast of characters. I love seeing Marra, third-born princess, sent to a religious order (sort of), and originally on her own to solve the world's problems. Only for her to collect a motley band of strange and wonderful allies, each in their own ways: a witch, a reluctant godmother, a night, a dog made of bones, and a demon made of chicken. (It makes sense). They're all great and I love the found family dynamic as they're off to save the world--or at least some tiny corner of it. 

As if that weren't enough, I love the prose and wordplay. It's *written* like a fairytale writ large. It just fits the story so well. 

Overall, One of the best books I've read this year and more than worth giving it a try.
