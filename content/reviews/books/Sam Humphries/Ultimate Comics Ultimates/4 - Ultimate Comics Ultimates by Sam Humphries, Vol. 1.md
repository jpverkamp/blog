title: Ultimate Comics Ultimates by Sam Humphries, Vol. 1
---
President Cap. Hydra. Fury doing Fury things. 

Itâ€™s certainly a jam packed volumeâ€¦ but for all that happens, what has actually changed?  

Feels like theyâ€™re trying to reboot a reboot while holding together entirely too much damage they (the writers) have done to this version of the universe. 

Overall: itâ€™s fine, but Iâ€™m not surprised that this line doesnâ€™t last long. Being yet another Volume 1 doesnâ€™t help. Onward!

Side note: Cap is a terrible President. ðŸ˜ƒ

You know, I kind of get the commentators that are saying he shouldnâ€™t be doing this. Thereâ€™s a whole country that needs savingâ€”especially now. Does the President ever have the time to save individuals?

As weird as it isâ€¦ this storyline is really starting to grow on me. 

Pun intended.

Here we go again?

Huh. Anthony is real enough to talk to external people. I somehow didnâ€™t expect that. More and more interesting.

I thought this universe already had a Vision. Who was both more female and not on Earth anymore.

And **what** exactly is he going to do?

Good.
