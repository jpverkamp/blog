Wow.

That is quite the conclusion. Everything that made [[The Fifth Season]]() and [[The Obelisk Gate]]() wonderful--the terrible, raw, apocalyptic nature of the world; the broken people who still hope, who still do what must be done; the complicated depths of magic and life and Earth. It's all here and and it's somehow... more.

As with the previous two books, we get a new point of view that broadens and deepens our understanding of the world, answering questions I didn't even think to ask and letting us all know that perhaps good and evil, the right and wrong choices are perhaps just a bit more complicated than that. Yet all along, people are going to do what needs to be done to survive. To thrive.

Let me just say, without reservation, that this is among the best (if not the very best) finale for a series I've ever read.  

Well, well well worth the read.
