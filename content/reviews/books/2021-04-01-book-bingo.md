I've seen the [/r/Fantasy Book Bingo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/mhz2tt/official_rfantasy_2021_book_bingo_challenge/) cards before a number of times, but this is the first year that I think I'm actually going to try it. I've gotten away from my previous reading lists, but this sounds like a great way to find new things / read a few that are out of my comfort zone. I do read a crazy amount, so I should be able to find time for 25 specific books--but then again, there are a few rules that might make this more interesting:

Rules:
- Must be speculative fiction (SF, fantasy, horror with speculative elements)
- Limit the number of novellas (fewer than 40k words or defined by the author as such) or combine them
- A book of short stories counts
- Graphic novels/manga should be treated as novellas
- Web novels count (if they're long enough)
- Audiobooks count

Luckily, there's a rather active [recommendations thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/mhz3k7/the_2021_rfantasy_bingo_recommendations_list/). Compare that against my to reads (still 600+ strong) or just whatever jumps out and I should be good to go!

This post will automatically update as I add more books. My current plan is to put each book in each category that it would work for, but when a book only fits in one category, I'll remove the other books from that category or otherwise mark it. 

In this case, the bold text is the category, while the text under it is 'hard mode'. I'll automatically qualify for 'hero mode', which is to review each book (since I do that anyways). 

Onward!
