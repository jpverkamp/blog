Well that's a lovely connection  

James Harriot (pen name for James Alfred Wight) was rural veterinarian in the middle of the 20th century in rural England. Once he turned 50 his wife encouraged him to follow his dreams and actually write a book, so he took his lifetime of experiences and stories and ... started writing about football. Which didn't work out. Eventually, he turned back to what he knew best with stories of the life and times of a country vet.

The stories are simple and uplifting and a perfect bedtime book. But even if you don't have kids to read to/with, you could probably do worse. They're cute books and (in the version I read) wonderfully illustrated.  

Well worth it.
