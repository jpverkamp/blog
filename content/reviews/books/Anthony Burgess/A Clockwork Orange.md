This... was truly a bizarre book.  

A terribly dark book of teenage hooligans raping and thieving their way through the nights, all speaking the most bizarre Russianish slang that's... interesting at best to read--up until the main character is caught and then re-educated in a perfect example of 'do the ends justify the means'. It's... really really bizarre.

It probably doesn't help when this version at least starts with an author's note that more or less tells you not to read the book:  

> I should myself be glad to disown it for various reasons, but this is not
> permitted. I receive mail from students who try to write theses about it, or
> requests from Japanese dramaturges to turn it into a sort of Noh play. It
> seems likely to survive, while other works of mine that I value more bite
> the dust. This is not an unusual experience for an artist.

At least the original 21st chapter is included? I'm not sure if it makes as large a difference as they claim it does.  

Overall, it's probably worth a read? Maybe? It's hard to say. Now I feel like I have to go watch the film. Wish me luck.

Drug milk. That's certainly a thing.

The ... whole dang book is like this. Sometimes better, sometimes worse. But man it's ... hard to read.

There's a hint of something really deep here with the whole 'ends justify the means'. I don't know if it's turly gone into in as much detail as it could be, but it's still an interesting thought.
