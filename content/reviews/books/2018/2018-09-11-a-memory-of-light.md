> There are no endings, and never will be endings, to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was an ending.

And oh what an ending it was.  

<!--more-->

Battle is joined throughout the world, with Trollocs pouring into the borderlands and through the Ways into Caemlyn. Taim shows his true colors. Rand tries to forge a Dragon's Peace, a legacy of   something other than death and destruction.  

And then. The Last Battle. A single chapter longer than many entire books. And what a chapter. The Shadow fields seemingly insurmountable armies, including hordes of channelers led by Demandred himself. Mat, the Son of Battles, Prince of the Ravens, is called upon to do what he does best.  

> “Yes, I'm alive," Mat said. "I'm usually pretty good at staying alive. I've only failed one time that I can remember, and it hardly counts.”

And even once that Last Battle is concluded, Rand fights his own private dual with the Dark One, only to realize that despite all his lofty dreams, without Evil, there is no way to choose to do Good.  

> The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again.

And so ends this cycle of the Wheel of Time. Give it a few years and I'm sure I'll read it again. It's worth it.
