{{< goodreads book="The Dark Prophecy" cover="true" >}}

{{< goodreads book="The Dark Prophecy" >}} is straight up a sequal to {{< goodreads book="The Hidden Oracle" >}}. Pretty much all of my comments from  apply here. Apollo is still a decent but not great main character, Meg is still odd and weirdly powerful. The world still feels like something we've seen done better in Riordan's other series.  

The main different of the Dark Prophecy and the part that amused me the most: it's almost completely set in Indianapolis. You don't get that overly often in fiction and it's always amusing to see it done. For someone that lives within spitting distance of Indianapolis, close enough.

Not the best book I've ever read, but still pretty solid. Worth a read if you've already given the Trials of Apollo a chance.
