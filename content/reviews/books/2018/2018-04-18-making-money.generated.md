> It was sad, like those businessmen who came to work in serious clothes but wore colorful ties in a mad, desperate attempt to show there was a free spirit in there somewhere.  

In {{< goodreads book="Going Postal" >}}, 'former' conman Moist von Lipwig rebuilt Ankh-Morpork post from the ground up... but now he's bored. Everything is running as it should; there's nothing left to fix. So when Vetinari offers him the chance to do the same to the bank... of course he runs the other way. One thing leads to another though and eventually the Moist ends up with a new dog who just so happens to own the majority share in the bank. Good times.

Once again Pratchett takes on a wide variety of related topics and Discworlds them. Does the gold standard actually make sense? What actually gives money its value? How does it work for a penny to be more expensive than a penny to make? It's fascinating and makes you want to compare it all to our own world.  

Characterwise, we have the return of a few from both Moist von Lipwig's subseries along with others from Ankh-Morpork--in particular Moist and Vetinari. On top of that, we have a few new minor characters--fun and unique as always. My favorite: Cosmo Lavish, a Vetinari-wanna-be going increasingly mad trying to emulate his hero. Fun times that.  

Overall, I think I liked Going Postal more, but Making Money is still well worth the read.
