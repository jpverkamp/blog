When youâ€™re (perpetually) on the run and need a favor, who do you call?

Kingpinâ€¦ apparently. 

So of course things go all sorts of sideways. And of course time travel gets involvedâ€”because comics. 

Delightful. 

And so ends the 2005-2008 run. Onwards!

Theyâ€™re so teenagers sometimesâ€¦ and back in New York.

I like Karolina and Xavin. And totally feel for Nico her. Trying to understand? Open foot, insert mouth.

Super Skrull! Powers of the Fantastic Four!

Some training required. 

Theyâ€™re so bad at this.

Molly is cute. **Nothing** permanent had better happen to her.

Daw. Especially because sheâ€™s totally right.

Oh Molly.

Superâ€¦ Zombie? Sure. Amusing pairing. ðŸ˜†

Aw. Closed time loops!
