{{< goodreads book="Silence Fallen" cover="true" >}}

I last read (/ listened to) the Mercy Thompson books back in 2016, so I thought it was about time to go through the series (plus the Alpha and Omega books) again. Imagine my delight when I saw both series had a new entry!

After the fallout of the deal with the werewolves and fae of a book ago, it seems someone (*cough*  {{< spoiler >}}Wolf{{< /spoiler >}}  *cough*) told the Master of Milan that the most powerful being in the Tri-Cities... was Mercy. So of course he has to go and kidnap her and drag her to Europe, leading to all of Mercy's 'friends' (Adam, Marsilia, goblins[^sayhuh], and a young werewolf named Matt Smith[^who]) come to rescue her while Mercy leads everyone on a wild chase across Europe after she escapes (spoilersish, but of course she's going to escape...).  

It's a solid book and feels both more grounded than fighting alongside Native avatars or against volcano gods while at the same time, expanding to a more worldly scope, seeing how the things go bump in other corners of the world.  

This is definitely among my favorites of the Mercy Thompson series. It doesn't look like there's any end in sight, so I'm looking forward to a few years from now where I can listen to the whole thing for a fifth reread!  

[^sayhuh]: Did I miss something? Everyone talks about the goblins like they're core characters to this world, but I don't really recall much about them before. Perhaps a side story or in the new Alpha and Omega? It's nothing world breaking, just felt weird.  

[^who]: Got the Doctor reference, but the rest... totally missed that. Well played Patricia Briggs.
