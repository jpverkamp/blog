Another year, another reading list.

This time around, I'm aiming for 120 books. 10 per month. One every 3 days. It's more than I've ever done. Probably won't make it. But it's worth trying, no?

<!--more-->

New books to read:

{{< goodreads book="Magic Bites" cover="true" >}}
{{< goodreads book="Skyward" cover="true" >}}
{{< goodreads book="We Are Legion (We Are Bob)" cover="true" >}}
{{< goodreads book="A Darker Shade of Magic" cover="true" >}}
{{< goodreads book="The Fallen" cover="true" >}}
{{< goodreads book="Children of the Nameless" cover="true" >}}
{{< goodreads book="First Shift: Legacy" cover="true" >}}
{{< goodreads book="Lilith's Brood" cover="true" >}}
{{< goodreads book="Midnight Curse" cover="true" >}}
{{< goodreads book="Aurora: CV-01" cover="true" >}}
{{< goodreads book="Sufficiently Advanced Magic" cover="true" >}}
{{< goodreads book="Sins of Empire" cover="true" >}}
{{< goodreads book="City of Stairs" cover="true" >}}

Series to (re-)listen to:

{{< goodreads book="Furies of Calderon" cover="true" >}}
{{< goodreads book="Storm Front" cover="true" >}}
{{< goodreads book="Wild Cards" cover="true" >}}

Series to re-read because there's a new entry:

{{< goodreads book="Legion" cover="true" >}}
{{< goodreads book="Burn Bright" cover="true" >}}
{{< goodreads book="Silence Fallen" cover="true" >}}

Haven't even counted this time around. If I run out of books, I can always add more. If I overestimated, I can always push them to next year. 

Here will be my list of reviews (it will update as each one is added):
