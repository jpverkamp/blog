And so it ends.  

> Their lives were now less than a footnote in history. As gone, as utterly forgotten as any random individual from the Middle Ages. No longer even a ripple in time, except to the extent that I could keep their memories alive. I sighed to myself. It seemed sometimes that life was nothing more than the accumulation of emotional baggageâ€”memories, regrets, and lost opportunities.

What {{< goodreads book="We Are Legion" text=" We Are Legion (We Are Bob) " >}} set up, {{< goodreads book="All These Worlds" text=" All These Worlds " >}} finished in spades. With literally hundreds of Bobs and a solid handful of storylines going on (overshadowed all the while by the overarching threat of the Others), it's a crazy book and a solid conclusion to the series.  

We Are Legion did a pretty good job of wrapping up most of those storylines, even introducing a few minor issues we hadn't seen before. The main storyline with the Others ends a bit abruptly, but I'm not sure how either side could have done more / prevented what happened. Well done that. Most of the minor storylines felt like satisfying and complete arcs as well[^exception], although there would certainly be room for any number of further stories.  

All together, that was a good book. If you like fairly episodic science fictioney stories... you could do far far worse. Give it a try.  

[^exception]: Although there's one fairly large exception, unless I missed something:  {{< spoiler >}}What about the Brazilian probes? For a relatively early and major protagonist, that's missing a fair bit.{{< /spoiler >}}
