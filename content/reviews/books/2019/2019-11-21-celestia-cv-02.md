{{< goodreads book="Celestia CV-02" cover="true" >}}

As one could probably guess from the title, {{< goodreads book="Celestia CV-02" >}} is the first book (after 7!) of the series that doesn't focus on the Aurora and her crew.  

On one hand, it's a nice change of pace and gives a much broader view of the universe the Aurora (and now Celestia) and their crews inhabit. On the other, we've spent a lot of time with the Aurora now! I want to know what's next! (We do get some Aurora time though.)

Other than that, we get a good amount of backstory on Earth and see the invasion of Jung. One thing that has been missing this entire time and is _still_ missing--which is starting to grow somewhat annoying--is any real insight into the Jung or view of their society. They're this big bad evil empire... that we know nothing about. I just hope we're not going to get a 'they were right all along twist at the end of this...  

Overall, you can tell that Ryk Brown's skill is getting far stronger as the series progresses and he wanted a more complicated structure. It's jarring at times, but I think it works. I'm especially glad that the overarching story around Earth is moving forward. I'm curious to see where it goes from here.
