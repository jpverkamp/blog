That was actually somewhat surprising for an ending. I expected a knock down, drag out fight with Roland, but instead...  {{< spoiler >}}Dragons. Of course it had to be dragons.{{< /spoiler >}}  

It's actually a pretty solid ending to the series, even if the final confrontations/battles did end rather abruptly and solve everything a bit too neatly. I almost want to see yet another book following the aftermath. But there's something to be said for letting an ending be an ending and I can respect that.

One of the most interesting things that I haven't seen much else of (yet) in urban fantasy was Kate and Curran's son and Kate's new role as a mother. There were times where it was a bit unbelieveable (any time Kate and Curran had to go off, they seemed to be able to easily find a sitter), but some of the troubles of a toddler felt all too familiar. And given that none of mine are magical or shapeshifters (although it feels like it sometimes)... all too real.  

> Yes, bad. Look at Daddy ripping the bad man to pieces. Go Daddy!

:)  

And hey, even more cases of redemption for characters I never expected it from. It's fascinating to read when done well... and I think it was done pretty well. Surprising. But well.  

Overall, it would have been a solid enough entry to the series. It's a bit lacking as the last book of a series, but it does a decent enough job of cleaning things up.  

I'm glad to have read this series. I think it's more than good enough to put on my list of series to re-read every couple of years. And check out some other works by the Andrews. Good times!
