{{< goodreads book="Magic Bites" text=" Magic Bites " >}} set up a fascinating world, full of cycles of tech and magic, with a wide variety of weres, mindless vampires controlled from afar  

This time around... A young girl to save. Magic flaring stronger than it has for years. Witches. Gods vying for rebirth. More Pack politics.  

Good times.  

The world building that intrigued me through Magic Bites carries through {{< goodreads book="Magic Burns" text=" Magic Burns " >}} in spades, answering a good number of the questions we had, while at the same time expanding things even further. The idea of a near apocalyptic Atlanta, ruined and rebuilt in the presence of cycling magic and tech is so crazy it's wonderful that it works. I really love the feel of this world.  

Characterwise, the new street kids Julie (yay) and Red (boo) really steal the show. You really feel for Julie, who's mom is a witch messing with things perhaps best left alone who has gone missing. And while it's really sad  {{< spoiler >}}her mom doesn't make it in the end, getting a new crazy Aunt Kate{{< /spoiler >}}  seems like an acceptable outcome. Temporary bad(ish) guy Bran is a lot of fun and seems just mad enough to actually be as old as he's supposed to be.  

Plotwise, things are fairly straight forward but get absolutely insane. It's interesting to see how the rules of this work and to realize that magic has not been back in the world for *that* long. The characters don't know much more about it than we did.  

After {{< goodreads book="Magic Bites" text=" Magic Bites " >}} , I thought the series was a decent enough plot wrapped around some world building with one heck of a lot of potential. After {{< goodreads book="Magic Burns" text=" Magic Burns " >}} , this series has the potential to be among my favorite urban fantasy series I've read (right up there with [ The Dresden Files ](https://www.goodreads.com/series/40346-the- dresden-files) and {{< goodreads series="Mercy Thompson" text=" Mercy Thompson " >}} ). It really is that good. Worth a try.
