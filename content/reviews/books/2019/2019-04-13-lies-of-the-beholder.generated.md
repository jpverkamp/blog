> “Who cares?” I said. “Yes, it’s all in my head. But pain is ‘all in my head’ too. Love is ‘all in my head.’ All the things that matter in life are the things you can’t measure! The things our brains make up! Being made-up doesn’t make them unimportant.”

It's been a few years since I last read {{< goodreads book="Legion" >}} and {{< goodreads book="Skin Deep" >}}, so when I saw a there was a new (and apparently last) part out, I had to give it a try. This time around, I listened to all three on audiobook and that, I can highly recommend. It's a solid production and each aspect having their own voice helps that little bit more.

Overall, it's an interesting expansion of the world, somewhat darker in tone and with a few more answers for things that had always been hinted at before (Sandra and the aspects they don't talk about any more) while at the same time raising more questions. It works decently as another chapter to the story... but as an ending it was weak. I'm not sure what answers to Sandra/dead aspects would have sufficed, but I just feel like it could have been better.  

That being said, the _idea_ of Legion remains absolutely fantastic and I really do love the characters, both real and (especially) imaginary. I know Sanderson doesn't plan to, but perhaps some day we'll see them again...
