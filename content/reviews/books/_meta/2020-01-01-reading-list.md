Every year, a reading list. I didn't make 120 books per year last year. As mentioned, I was doing pretty well until. And then October hit, with a pile of birthdays. And November, with [NaNoWriMo]({{< ref "2019-11-25-nanowrimo-2019-winner" >}}). And then the holidays. Thanksgiving. Christmas. So I think this year, I'm going to back down to 100 again, trying to hit that by the end of October. Then I can read with less pressure through the rest of the year.

First, I have all of the series I'm either finishing from last year or rereading/re-listening too because of a new entry: 


| Series | Category | Books | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|-------|
| {{< goodreads book="Aurora: CV-01" cover="true" >}} | Fiction | 2* | Finishing from 2019 |
| {{< goodreads book="The Pillars of the Earth" cover="true" >}} | Email Book Club, Fiction | 2* | Finishing from 2019 |
| {{< goodreads book="Pacific Vortex!" cover="true" >}} | Audiobook, Fiction | 20* | Finishing from 2019 |
| {{< goodreads book="Midnight Curse" cover="true" >}} | Fiction | 3 | Carry over |
| {{< goodreads book="Sufficiently Advanced Magic" cover="true" >}} | Fiction | 2 | Carry over |
| {{< goodreads book="Sins of Empire" cover="true" >}} | Fiction | 3 | Carry over |
| {{< goodreads book="City of Stairs" cover="true" >}} | Fiction | 3 | Carry over |
| {{< goodreads book="Storm Front" cover="true" >}} | Audiobook, Fiction | 16 | Reread with a new sequel |
| {{< goodreads book="The Way of Kings" cover="true" >}} | Audiobook (?), Fiction | 4 | Reread with a new sequel | 
| {{< goodreads book="The Black Prism" cover="true" >}} | Audiobook (?), Fiction | 5 | Reread with a new sequel | 
| {{< goodreads book="Skyward" cover="true" >}} | Fiction | 2 | Reread with a new sequel | 

That's already a 62 books, so should hold me through half the year (if I keep up 10 books a month as long as I can).

After that, I have a few non-fiction books I wanted to read (and already own):

{{< goodreads book="On Writing and Worldbuilding, Volume I" cover="true" >}}
{{< goodreads book="How To: Absurd Scientific Advice for Common Real-World Problems" cover="true" >}}
{{< goodreads book="Hyperbole and a Half: Unfortunate Situations, Flawed Coping Mechanisms, Mayhem, and Other Things That Happened" cover="true" >}}
{{< goodreads book="Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!" cover="true" >}}

After that... I think I'm going to try something new this year. 

I have such a crazy to-read list (back up to 593, and that only counts the first book per series) that I can never choose in a way that's satisfactory. Plus, I want to write more programming posts this year (I haven't for months now...). 

So my goal is before I run out of books on my reading list, I will create a tool that can read in my Goodreads shelves, weight books on various criteria (what I've read recently to create variety, prefer books I already own, prefer a wider variety of authors), and give me a mostly random set of 3 to choose from. 

Here will be my list of reviews (it will update as each one is added, or you can subscribe [via RSS](/reviews/lists/2020-book-reviews/atom.xml)):
