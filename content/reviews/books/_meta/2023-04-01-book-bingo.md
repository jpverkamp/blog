Two years down [2021]({{< ref "2021-04-01-book-bingo" >}}), [2022]({{< ref "2022-04-01-book-bingo" >}}) and yet another one to go!

Much more breathing room last year than the year before (two weeks!) and I've already been reading more this year, so I'm confident. Let's do it. 

As a side note, if anyone I know wants to read along on any of these, drop me a line. Love to chat about books. :smile: 

Rules:
- Must be speculative fiction (SF, fantasy, horror with speculative elements)
- Limit the number of novellas (fewer than 40k words or defined by the author as such) or combine them
- A book of short stories counts
- Graphic novels/manga should be treated as novellas
- Web novels count (if they're long enough)
- Audiobooks count

This post will automatically update as I tag books and I'll post ~if~ when I finish! I'm going to go for hard mode again as much as possible. Should be fun. :D
