Another year older and another year of reading. I set myself the entirely insane goal of 120 books this year--10 a month--almost one every three days. And for most of the year, I was actually hitting that goal. And then October hit, with a pile of birthdays. And November, with [NaNoWriMo]({{< ref "2019-11-25-nanowrimo-2019-winner" >}}) (still going strong at just over 120k words; I should be done in the next day or two). And then the holidays. Thanksgiving. Christmas. Not really an excuse. More of an explination. 

Alltogether, I read 113 books this year. One of those I finished today...

I don't think I'll do that again next year. Perhaps we'll go for 100 again and try to hold to ten books a year up through October. That seems much more manageable now...

It looks pretty rediculous when you write it all out like that doesn't it. And that's only one book per series. Some of those (*cough* {{< goodreads series="The Grand Tour" >}} *cough* took a while). 

Of those, a bit under half were audiobooks (52) and 9 were non-fiction. Eight I read with my wife discussing one chapter a day as a sort of email book club. 

I read a few novels as short as {{< goodreads book="Legion" >}} at 88 pages and a few doorstoppers: {{< goodreads book="The Pillars of the Earth" >}} is just shy of 1000. Overall, I read or listened to just over 40,000 words, increasing my general average to 110 pages per day or 350 ber book. 

I continue to rate books highly, averaging 4.4 stars. I hope this coming year to get away from star ratings in general. They're not super helpful if you're reading books that you already expect to like (for the most part). 

As mentioned before, there are a few series that I'll be continuing into the new year:

| Series | Books Left |
|--------|------------|
| {{< goodreads book="Aurora: CV-01" cover="true" >}} | 1
| {{< goodreads book="The Pillars of the Earth" cover="true" >}} | 2 |
| {{< goodreads book="Pacific Vortex!" cover="true" >}} | 25, plus spin off series (plural) |

And there are a few I just didn't get to which I'll be bumping to next year:

| Series | Category | Books |
|--------|----------|-------|
| {{< goodreads book="Midnight Curse" cover="true" >}} | Fiction | 3 |
| {{< goodreads book="Sufficiently Advanced Magic" cover="true" >}} | Fiction | 2 |
| {{< goodreads book="Sins of Empire" cover="true" >}} | Fiction | 3 |
| {{< goodreads book="City of Stairs" cover="true" >}} | Fiction | 3 |

Nowhere near as bad as least year! Look for my 2020 reading list tomorrow.
