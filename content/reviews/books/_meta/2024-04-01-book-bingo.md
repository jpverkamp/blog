Let's do it again!

Previous years:

* [[2021 Book Bingo|2021]]()
* [[2022 Book Bingo|2022]]()
* [[2023 Book Bingo|2022]]()

If anyone I know wants to read along on any of these, drop me a line. Love to chat about books! :smile: 

Rules:
- Must be speculative fiction (SF, fantasy, horror with speculative elements)
- Limit the number of novellas (fewer than 40k words or defined by the author as such) or combine them
- A book of short stories counts
- Graphic novels/manga should be treated as novellas
- Web novels count (if they're long enough)
- Audiobooks count

This post will automatically update as I tag books and I'll post ~if~ when I finish! I'm going to go for hard mode again as much as possible. Should be fun. :D
