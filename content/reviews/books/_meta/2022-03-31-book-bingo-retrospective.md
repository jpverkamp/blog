I made it*!

[My original goal]({{<ref "2021-04-01-book-bingo">}}) was to finish all 25 books on the Book Bingo card, every one of them on hardmode. With two exceptions, I made it (see below). You can click any book to read my review:

{{< bingo "2021 Book Bingo" >}}

The two exceptions:

* Per the rules, you can replace one square. I never quite did the book club thing, so I replaced 'r/Fantasy Book Club (Hard: with participation)' with a previous square: 'Sequel: Not the First Book in the Series (2017)'. 
* [[Black Sun]]() meets 'Trans or Nonbinary', but I misread the recommendation thread before I started: xe is not a protagonist. It's still a wonderful book and I'm glad to have read it, but I didn't have time to read another book for this square. I'll try to catch one [next time around]({{<ref "2022-04-01-book-bingo">}}). 

Also:

* I used graphic novels for three squares. Normally, they'd count as novellas, but in each case I read the entire (or almost entire in Hellblazer's case) series, which was 10+ books in each case. I think that certainly brings it up and over the page / time requirements for a novel.
* I ended up reading four books in two days to finish off. Maybe I'll make sure to finish a bit earlier next year... (maybe)

I don't think there was a single book on the list that I hated; instead, here are some that I particularly loved and can wholeheartedly recommend you read!

* [[The House in the Cerulean Sea]]() - A delightful found family / coming of age story that really tugs on your emotions
* [[Mexican Gothic]]() - Slow burn collision of worlds between Mexican young woman and English gentleman turns super creepy
* [[Six Wakes]]() - Closed room murder mystery IN SPACE--and the best part: with cloning, they all very well COULD HAVE DONE IT
* [[Cece Rios and the Desert of Souls]]() - A quick read with Coyote myths, Latin American beasties, and a young girl that's very well going to save the day
* [[Annihilation]]() - Slice of life meets cosmic horror; exploring a weird tear without* going mad--much better than the sequels
* [[Gideon the Ninth]]() - 'Lesbian Necromancers in Space'--but really, it's an excellent blending of necromancy and spaceships with some excellent super snarkyÂ humor 
* [[An Alchemy of Masques and Mirrors]]() - a wonderfully weird steampunk world full of airships, crazy magic, and delightful characters
* [[Project Hail Mary]]() - scientific/engineering problem solving mixed with humor as Andy Weird does best
* [[Black Sun]]() - dark and beautiful pre-colonial Middle America based worldbuilding with a lot of interesting dichotomies
* [[The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet]]() - a slice of life deep in space chock full of fascinating alien feeling aliens and relationships
