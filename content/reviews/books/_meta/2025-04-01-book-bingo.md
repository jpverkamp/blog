Let's do it again (again (again (again)))!

Previous years:

* [2024 Book Bingo]({{< ref "2024-04-01-book-bingo" >}})
* [2023 Book Bingo]({{< ref "2023-04-01-book-bingo" >}})
* [2022 Book Bingo]({{< ref "2022-04-01-book-bingo" >}})
* [2021 Book Bingo]({{< ref "2021-04-01-book-bingo" >}})

Rules:
- Must be speculative fiction (SF, fantasy, horror with speculative elements)
- Limit the number of novellas (fewer than 40k words or defined by the author as such) or combine them
- A book of short stories counts
- Graphic novels/manga should be treated as novellas
- Web novels count (if they're long enough)
- Audiobooks count

I'll admit I'm not *super* thrilled that we have both Book Club and Not a Book with 'participation' hard modes. I always replace that square We'll see how that goes this year.
