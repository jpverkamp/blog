I 2015, I set myself an ~~ambitious~~ ~~slightly~~ insane reading goal: 100 books.

My final count: exactly 100 books (from ~30 different series), totaling 38,048 pages. There were a few short stories in there ({{< goodreads book="Pimpf" >}} by {{< goodreads author="Charles Stross" >}} was the shortest at 25 pages) to offset a couple epic fantasies (1,048 pages in {{< goodreads author="Brandon Sanderson" text="Brandon Sanderson's" >}} {{< goodreads book="Words of Radiance" >}}). Overall, I averaged 388 pages/book, which sounds about right to me.

For the longest time, I was average right at 100 pages per day, but over the last week or so (in a last burst to finish the year), that bumped up slightly. I ended up at an average of 104 pages / day. None too shabby.

Rating-wise, I rated a full quarter of the books I read 5 out of 5. Less than 20 were three stars or less. My average rating was 4.2. If that sounds a bit high... it should be. These are the books that I put on my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com">Goodreads</a> list since I wanted to read them. Of those, I took the subset of those that I particularly wanted to read for 2015. So it's no surprise that I (for the most part) selected books I thought I would like.

From my original list ([2015 Reading List]({{< ref "2015-12-31-reading-list-retrospective.md" >}})), I at least started every series (Mere Christianity I'm reading at two chapters per week, so I'm still working on it). I even added a few that weren't originally on there:

{{< goodreads book="Earth Unaware" cover="true" >}}
{{< goodreads book="Elantris" cover="true" >}}
{{< goodreads book="The Alloy of Law" cover="true" >}}
{{< goodreads book="The Golem and the Jinni" cover="true" >}}
{{< goodreads book="Zoo City" cover="true" >}}
{{< goodreads book="Mister Monday" cover="true" >}}

Overall, I greatly enjoyed reading as much as I did. According to Goodreads, I only read 10 in 2014. Perhaps though, I should aim for something in between those two... Look tomorrow for my 2016 reading list.
