BINGO!

One year ago, I started my (second) {{<crosslink "2022 Book Bingo">}}. Let's see how I did! 

{{< bingo "2022 Book Bingo" >}}

So far as I believe, I actually hit hardmode for all of the squares this time, although I did replace one of the squares again this year (for row 2, column 3 instead of book club, I pulled in found family again and did hard mode). 

Stats wise, I had 3 graphic novels again. But once again, I'm counting the entire run as a book, so I think timewise it's aligned with if not more than a single book. 

## Mini-reviews for each book

Or click through / click any of the covers above for full reviews. 

My favorites are marked with \[!\].

Yes, I have a lot of favorites. It was a good year.

Graphic novels are marked with \[g\]. In each case, I read the entire series of ~10+, which all together is well more than a single novel (IMO). It's a great format for storytelling.

\[!\] [Foundryside](https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/06/foundryside/) by Robert Jackson Bennett

*   A book on [r/Fantasy’s Top LGBTQIA List](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ifmx04/rfantasys_2020_top_lgbtqa_books_voting_results/) (Hard: A book/series with ten votes or less)
    
*   Excellent world/magic building; I love stories where magic is basically re-programming reality. On top of that, I love the characters. A 'damn good thief' with some magical tricks, a cop obsessed with justice to a fault, the grumpy mentor, and his even more brilliant assistant. It's all there.
    

[The Bone Ships](https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/03/the-bone-ships/) by R.J. Barker

*   Weird Ecology (Hard: Not written by Jeff VanderMeer or China Miéville)
    
*   A primarily nautical setting with ships that are built out of the bones of giant sea monsters. If you like sea-themed stories, you'll love this, there's a ton of it.
    

[The Vela](https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/22/the-vela/) by Yoon Ha Lee, Becky Chambers, Rivers Solomon, S.L. Huang

*   Two or More Authors (Hard: Three or More)
    
*   One of the modern serial stories written for [Realm.fm](https://Realm.fm) (originally Serial Box), it's from 4 authors that I've either previously loved or are high on my to read list. It's set against a solar system where mining the sun is freezing out the outer worlds. Climate refuges, writ large. On top of that, you have the contrast between the main characters (a mercenary/sniper from one of the outer worlds and the child of the current president with hacking skills) is a shining jewel of the series. It's fascinating to see how the different authors handle it.
    

[A Declaration of the Rights of Magicians](https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/23/a-declaration-of-the-rights-of-magicians/) by H.G. Parry

*   Historical SFF (Hard: Not based in Britain or Ireland)
    
    *   Stretching the 'not in Britain' a bit, in that a good chunk of the book does take place in Britain, but I would argue that especially in this book a large part of the plot is focused on the French Revolution with another plotline in the Americas.
        
*   Historical fantasy. Take the French revolution, add class based magic (fire, water, weather, mind control) and vampires (really 'blood magic') and see what happens. It has the same problems most historical fantasy has, if you take a topic like slavery or broad classism and justify it as 'because magic/vampires' it somewhat removes the blames from those who really caused the issues. Still an interesting book.
    

\[!\] [Consider Phlebas](https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/11/consider-phlebas/) by Iain M. Banks

*   Set in Space (Hard: Characters not originally from Earth)
    
*   I'm not sure how I've not read the Culture before. Take "a utopian, post-scarcity space society of humanoid aliens, and advanced superintelligent artificial intelligences living in artificial habitats spread across the Milky Way galaxy" and then realize that even in a 'utopia' people are still people (even non-Human people) and you end with an action-filled romp across a bunch of exotic settings, mixing far future technology and timeless problems.
    

[The Starless Sea](https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/05/the-starless-sea/) by Erin Morgenstern

*   Standalone (Hard: not on [r/Fantasy’s Favorite Standalones List](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/e9ukxr/the_2019_rfantasy_favourite_standalones_poll/))
    
*   It's got absolutely beautiful prose and visuals. The sights and smells of books and libraries and doors. And then... I still don't even know what was actually going on. I love a good slice of life / cozy fantasy (see later), but this didn't really have even that.
    

\[!\] [A Deadly Education](https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/13/a-deadly-education/) by Naomi Novik

*   Anti-Hero (Hard: YA)
    
*   What Harry Potter / other magic school books wish they were. It's got a more or less typical teenage protagonist doing typical teenage protagonist things... all the while trying to learn from a school that is doing it's level best to kill her. Wonderful worldbuilding. Magic, mad science, and downright Cthulhian besties.
    

\[!\] \[g\] [The Wicked + The Divine, Vol. 1: The Faust Act](https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/17/the-wicked--the-divine-vol.-1-the-faust-act/) by Kieron Gillen

*   Book Club / Readalong (Hard: With participation)
    
    *   I don't really do large book clubs / readalongs. Maybe next year. Replaced with (2021) Found Family (Hard: Featuring an LGBTQ+ character), still hard mode.
        
*   What if every 90 years a selection of 12(ish) young adults suddenly gained the powers and to some extent the personalities of various gods--knowing that in two years they would die. It's quite literally "better to burn out than to fade away" writ large. And it gets even crazier from there.
    

\[!\] \[g\] [Runaways, Vol. 1: Pride and Joy](https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/21/runaways-vol.-1-pride-and-joy/) by Brian K. Vaughan

*   Cool Weapon (Hard: Weapon has a unique name)
    
*   Imagine being a teenager in the Marvel Universe (so superheroes are a thing). Now imagine finding out (forcefully) that your parents are actually the bad guys (tm). It's a neat premise and they manage to get a lot of interesting story out of it.
    

[Paradise Lost](https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/12/paradise-lost/) by John Milton

*   Revolutions and Rebellions (Hard: Main focus of the plot)
    
*   That's a weird one. It's basically the story of the Fall of Satan + the book of Genesis, wrapped up in a bunch of nice flowery poetry, writ long. It's really interesting but I hesitate to say it's actually particularly good. It's also so long.
    

\[g\] [The Unwritten, Vol. 1: Tommy Taylor and the Bogus Identity](https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/20/the-unwritten-vol.-1-tommy-taylor-and-the-bogus-identity/) by Mike Carey, Bill Willingham

*   Character’s Name in the Title (Hard: Includes first and last name)
    
*   What if the author of Harry Potter had a son. Who they named Harry Potter. And modeled the story as closely as possible on real\* Harry Potter's life. And then add in a neat book based magic, hopping to parallel worlds, and all sorts of meta implications about how the (in-story) universe works.
    

\[!\] [Nettle & Bone](https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/01/nettle-bone/) by T. Kingfisher

*   Author Uses Initials (Hard: Initials are a pseudonym and not the author’s actual name)
    
*   A dark sort of fairy tale, which is great even by itself. On top of that, you have interesting magic (using wire to put together the skeleton of a dog to raise yourself a familiar) and an interesting, rag tag bunch of characters off to save the kingdom / princess.
    

\[!\] [Legends & Lattes](https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/12/legends-lattes/) by Travis Baldree

*   Published in 2022 (Hard: Debut)
    
*   A retired orc barbarian and a succubus with artistic flair open a coffee shop. And it's not even a joke. It's cozy fantasy in a nutshell. No one dies, the world isn't ending, the main character just wants to open a coffee shop. It's like a hug in book form.
    

\[!\] [Succulents and Spells](https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/03/succulents-and-spells/) by Andi C. Buchanan

*   Urban Fantasy (Hard: LGBTQ+ POV character)
    
*   Another cozy fantasy, this time urban fantasy in a world mostly like ours, but with (semi-?)hidden witches and the possibility of getting a PhD in the monster hiding under your bed. It's cute and a quick, fun read.
    

\[!\] [The Rage of Dragons](https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/17/the-rage-of-dragons/) by Evan Winter

*   Set in Africa (Hard: Author is of African heritage)
    
*   African-inspired Bronze-age fantasy with caste-based tension, crazy swords, demons, dragons, and the feeling that the good guys might not be so good after all. You have the super talented main character, doing things otherwise thought impossible. He's a bit hard to read at times, but still fun.
    

\[!\] [The Galaxy, and the Ground Within](https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/22/the-galaxy-and-the-ground-within/) by Becky Chambers

*   Non-Human Protagonist (Hard: Non-humanoid)
    
*   The 4th 'cozy / slice of life sci-fi' of the Wayfarers series (I read the first just at the end of last year's bingo). Each one has almost a completely different cast, albeit with some overlap. This is no different following a bunch of aliens stranded at the sci-fi equivalent of a truck stop as the sky rains down on them. It's all about how people are people, no matter how literally alien they are.
    

\[!\] [The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August](https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/14/the-first-fifteen-lives-of-harry-august/) by Claire North

*   Wibbly Wobbly Timey Wimey; time doesn’t behave as it should (Hard: No time travel)
    
*   Take the timeloop premise of Groundhog Day (et al), apply it to lifetimes, add a few neat worldbuilding twists, break things up with a cataclysm coming back through time… and you have The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August. I love all of those things, so of course I love this book as well. :D One of the best parts is the idea that in a world with a number of these 'immortals' time can be flexible. Pass a message to an immortal about to die... and they'll remember it decades earlier when next their born.
    

[Skin and Other Stories](https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/02/skin-and-other-stories/) by Roald Dahl

*   Five SFF Short Stories (Hard: Entire collection)
    
    *   They're probably arguably more horror / thriller, but there are certainly some fantastical elements.
        
*   So... the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and James and the Giant Peach wrote some more adult horror. Which in hindsight makes sense. Those books have some seriously creepy bits if you think about them enough.
    

\[!\] [The Outside](https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/21/the-outside/) by Ada Hoffman

*   Features Mental Health (Hard: Not the Stormlight Archive or on [this list](https://www.tor.com/2020/09/22/8-sff-books-that-center-mental-health/))
    
*   Well that’s certainly an interesting book. It’s one part autism as ‘different, but that’s okay and sometimes it’s a superpower and sometimes it sucks’, one part cosmic horror, and one part fascinating worldbuilding with technoreligion writ large. I enjoyed it, even if it felt rough at times.
    

\[!\] [Letters from a Shipwreck in the Sea of Suns and Moons](https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/11/letters-from-a-shipwreck-in-the-sea-of-suns-and-moons/) by Raymond St. Elmo

*   Self-Published OR Indie Publisher (Hard: Fewer than 100 ratings or with an AMA)
    
*   That… is a truly delightfully weird book. It jumps around in structure and time between letters from a sailor to the girl he left back home–to said sailor being interviewed by … someone–to stories about a most mysterious shipwreck and the island he came to inhabit thereafter. Structurally, it’s very strange and at times hard to figure out what in the world is going on–but that’s all intentional. It’s really quite worth it in the end.
    

[Last Argument of Kings](https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/17/last-argument-of-kings/) by Joe Abercrombie

*   Award Finalist, But Not Won (Hard: Neither Hugo- nor Nebula-nominated)
    
*   Another 'how haven't you read him' author: Joe Abercrombie. It's dark, gritty fantasy. throughout the series, it's fascinating he can do with characters. Glokta is a terrible person–and he makes us root for him. Logen is a berserker in the truest sense–and he makes us feel sorry for him. Jezal is excellent at failing upward–and he makes us feel sorry for him. It’s all around amazing and the real strength of the series.
    

[A Snake Falls to Earth](https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/06/a-snake-falls-to-earth/) by Darcie Little Badger

*   BIPOC Author (Hard: Indigenous author)
    
*   I do love stories that take mythology I don’t know as well and expands on it. In this case, the Lipan (Apache) people of what became the southwestern US down into Mexico. The idea of a world inhabited by animal people–those that can shape shift between an animal and a human form–that was once connected to Earth… and now is not. I don’t think I’ve ever otherwise seen a cottonmouth shifter, especially not the equivalent of a teenage one. It’s a lot of fun. And seeing how her and Nina (our human/our world protagonist) eventually interact is just great.
    

[Out of the Blue](https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/28/out-of-the-blue/) by Jason June

*   Shapeshifters (Hard: Most prominent shifter is not a were/dog shifter)
    
*   Take part gay teenage lifeguard lover of rom-coms, just broken up with the Love Of His Life(tm), add a non-binary (because they all are) mermaid, sent on a month long [Rumspringa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumspringa) to the surface, make it into a love story (of course) with all the (teenage) relationship twists and turns that entails ... and you have Out of the Blue. It's not my usual sort of book, but I did enjoy it.
    

\[!\] [All Systems Red](https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/08/all-systems-red/) by Martha Wells

*   No Ifs, Ands, or Buts; Title doesn’t contain the, a/an, and, or, if, of, but (Hard: Title is three words or more)
    
*   Okay, I get what all the hype is about. Take a heavily armed cyborg/clone, designed entirely as muscle to defend the more squishy ’traditional’ humans, have it turn off the software constraining it from killing everyone, add in a wonderfully snarky sense of humor… and see what happens. Murderbot is a wonderful protagonist.
    

[Shaman](https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/08/shaman/) by Kim Stanley Robinson

*   Family Matters (Hard: At least three generations)
    
*   Take a survival story (a la Gary Paulsen’s Hatchet), re-tune it for a world where survival is life rather than a temporary situation (ten thousand or so years ago), sprinkle in an oddly modern feeling narrator, and make it super horny… voila. Shaman.
