> Not all who wander are lost; some are on quests.

That was a very strange book. More than anything, it felt like 'what if all of the more *game* parts of Dungeons and Dragons were real, what would that change about the world?'. Oh, and dig into the economics of it along the way. 

We literally have an adventuring industry with heroes funded by corporate interests buying stakes in the eventual loot. Some sort of 'level' system where you can turn in records of kills for advancement. Noncombat Paper Carries (NPCs). 

It's... a D&D satire. 

I think the biggest weakness to me was more one of expectations. I actually expected it to go even more into the economics (that don't really make *any* sense) of a adventuring based society. It's there, but it could have been so much more!

That being said, I did enjoy the book, it was a fun read and the sense of humor was on point. I'll have to check out the sequels at some point.
