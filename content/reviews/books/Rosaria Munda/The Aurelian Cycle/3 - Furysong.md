> When a government ceases to protect its people, it becomes necessary to overthrow it.

Oy. 

That's how you end a trilogy. 

Revolution on revolution, coup on coup. Love and hate, betrayal and double/triple/who even knows crossing. And death. Oh the deaths. 

Finally, we get a conclusion (for now) of the revolution we were first introduced to in [[Fireborne]](). And the government in exile of [[Flamefall]](). 

The characters are still a large driving factor here, especially (but not only!) Annie and Lee. We finally get an answer to the whole 'will they / won't they' which I expect we all saw coming, but it's all in *how* it happened... and what came next. There's a lot of sweet here--and more than a helpful of bittersweet as well. 

On top of that Griff is a fascinating point here. He got everything he wanted in [[Flamefall]]() and a few things that he couldn't bear. So for half the book, he's the hero--and drowning himself in his sorrows. But add in Delo as an actual point of view this time around? A plot well worth it. 

On the antagonists side, we have Ixion. Oh we love to hate them. Being the last book, they have to fall, but it's going to be a long painful trip to get there. The (re)introduction of the Bassileans, their princess, and their gargantuan dragon. I think that's a sort of difference in dragon breeds and hints at a larger world that I could do with more of. It's interesting to realize that for all the chaos we've been through with these books, they're only a tiny part of the larger world. 

And then there's Power. He is very much the most complicated character in these books, thoroughly in the morally gray category. Oh Power. 

Overall, I loved these books. I'm going to have to see what else [[Rosaria Munda]]() has done! Onward!
