I've played a number of Zachtronics games. [SpaceChem](http://www.zachtronics.com/spacechem/) and [Opus Magnum](http://www.zachtronics.com/opus-magnum/). [TIS-100](http://www.zachtronics.com/tis-100/) and [Ironclad Tactics](http://www.zachtronics.com/ironclad-tactics/). For a programmer/code geek/puzzle lover like me, they're a wonderful sort of thing.  

And from the standpoint of someone that's made a few very small games, loves to learn about how they're made, and would like to do more with game design, [[ZACH-LIKE, A Game Design History]]() is a fascinating read.

Basically, it goes through a large chunk of the notes Zach Barth has made for games both released and unreleased, going all the way to middle school. It's a fascinating dig into planning and interesting to see what worked and what didn't work.  

I think the main negative is actually that there are a few games I _haven't_ played ([EXAPUNKS](http://www.zachtronics.com/exapunks/), [Shenzhen I/O](http://www.zachtronics.com/shenzhen-io/), and [infinifactory](http://www.zachtronics.com/infinifactory/)!) and now I want to play them! And I didn't have nearly as much context for what the notes actually meant/what might have changed. So it goes.  

An interesting read. And you can't beat [the price](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098840/ZACHLIKE/)!
