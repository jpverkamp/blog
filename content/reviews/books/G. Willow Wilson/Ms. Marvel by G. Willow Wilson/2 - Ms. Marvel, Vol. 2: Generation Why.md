You know all those rumors about pet alligators flushed down the sewers?

Yeah, they generally fail to mention the freakin laser beams. 

Comics are weird. Volume 2 and we’re already with the crossovers (hallucinatory Avengers don’t count). So many crossovers. But they’re cute! And it’s still mostly Ms. Marvel calling the shots. 

A solid volume 2! Onward!

It’s interesting. And I bet we’ll barely dig into it at most!

So go comics.
