…

Well. As far as hooks go, that is most certainly one of them. 

Pity it’s only got one volume. 

Other than that we get the introduction of Kamran—instant meetcute with Kamala, what can possibly go wrong—inhuman strife, and… a S.H.I.E.L.D. crossover?

Looks fun. Maybe I’ll read that one next. 

Anyways, everything feels like it’s flying by, in the way of comics. It takes too long to illustrate an entire volume, so everything gets crammed together. 

Onward!

Yeah, that’s pretty teenagers… (I think; it’s been a year or two)
