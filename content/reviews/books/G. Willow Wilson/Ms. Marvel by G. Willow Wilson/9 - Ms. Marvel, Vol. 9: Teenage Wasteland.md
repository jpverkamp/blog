## Teenage Wasteland

Ironic that. 

A whole Ms. Marvel story about when itâ€™s all too much and Kamala steps down. 

Itâ€™s such a cute story. Some friends step up to (try) to take her place. Some (try to) track her down â€¦ for a sandwich.  Itâ€™s what friendship is about. 

Oh. And somehow the Inventor is back. But thatâ€™s not really the point now, is it?

I really liked this one.

##  Something New

Baby!

But thatâ€™sâ€¦ totally only the first few pages. After that, we get Bruno back (for a visit? Or more?), a new kid at schoolâ€¦ that can crush lockers with her bare hands, and oh so much relationship drama. 

Itâ€™s a good time. 

I wonder of Bruno shows up in any Black Panther issues while he was there.

Brunoâ€™s reaction was pretty delightful.
