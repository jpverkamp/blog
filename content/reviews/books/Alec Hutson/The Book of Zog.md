Zogrusz is an Eldrich Horror, a being from beyond time and space. But... a nice one? That just wants to do the right thing? 

The book follows Zog and the quasi-Earth (it's never entirely clear) he settles on through thousands of years (mostly with large time jumps) and the rise and fall of various religions up to (and through) and approaching cosmic horror style end of the world.

I greatly enjoy the characters (Zog especially, but also Rhas the 'cat' and rival Anecoya). The plot was great when it was going through the growth of the world, but got more than a touch weird as the book went on, so your mileage may vary there. The universe building and digging just a bit into what religions can mean? 

> “You felt saved . . . because the gods did not care?”

> “Yes!” Izel cried, and the fervor in his voice sent a thrill through Zogrusz. “If the gods truly loved and cared for us, then it was my fault that my wife and son had died. Because I was not worthy, they had suffered terribly! This was punishment for my failure! But if the universe was uncaring . . . then I was not to blame. The words of Zogrusz untied the blindfold from my eyes. I saw that there is nothing greater that will descend to save us . . . if we wish to live in a better world, we must strive to create it ourselves! Zogrusz is my god because He is the only one who presents the truth of the universe honestly. All the others lie for our devotion . . . but not Him!”

It's certainly an interesting take on it! 

In my opinion, worth a read for the premise alone. I'm curious to see what else the author has in store.
