> Marigold took a deep breath. "My name is Marigold Ann Nightfield. I use she/her pronouns. I'm a PhD
candidate in biomedical science."

That was delightful. It's a cozy urban fantasy, light and cute with just enough touches of something bigger and more dangerous out there. 

Well worth a read. And at a novella length 100 pages, it's worth trying just to see if you like it. And if you do, there are a handful more to dig deeper! (I haven't yet). 

<!--more-->

A bit deeper, at it's heart the strength of the story is in the characters. We have a young (20 something?) woman from a large family of witches who hasn't quite found her way (and at that age, who has) runs into another young woman from a much smaller, wealthier family--also with witches, if less--who studies the Monsters that hide under your bed academically. 

It's such a fun premise and watching the two find their way through life (and eventually towards each other) is just... fun.

I like the variety of witches, even if we don't get many details at all about them, and the thought that went into making Monsters more 'real'. Well done that, if light. 


> "I'll be twenty-four in November. I know I come across young. It's because I'm autistic, and enthusiastic about things, and also because of my skin."

It's nice to have autistic characters. Especially when it's who she, but not *all* who she is.
