Spider-Women team up!

Coming soon to an Earth-65 near you. 

Also, that’s certainly an art style. It’s jarring in most crossovers but even more so in this one for some reason. 

Anyways. 

The idea of Jessica Drew’s alternate Agent Drew being a man is somewhat amusing, given her Ultimate version. 

It’s fascinating to see someone so potentially character defining to Spider-Gwen—{{<spoiler>}}like losing her powers!{{</spoiler>}}—be in a crossover story. 

I missed this as I was first planning... Glad I went back and caught it, kind of important that one. 

On it's own, it's a weird and chaotic story (as most dimension hopping ones tend to be, with multiple copies of multiple characters flying around), but it's fairly solid. And like I said, important for the Spider-Gwen storyline!

Onward!

*That* is most certainly a Doc Oc.
