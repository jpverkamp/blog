So much continues to change in the Post-Wave world...

So instead let’s introduce some new foe in the Mandarin. Hacking in and taking over Stark Tech. The Iron Man suit. 

Neat idea but feels incomplete. Both in what I expected post Ultimatum and in the resolution. 

Onward.

That’s an unexpected look for Jarvis.
