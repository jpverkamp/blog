> Walking through Harlem first thing in the morning was like being a single drop of blood inside an enormous body that was waking up. Brick and mortar, elevated train tracks, and miles of underground pipe, this city lived; day and night it thrived.

At first, it's a story about a black man in the boroughs of New York in the 1920s. A gritty world, but somehow *alive*, dripping with some wonderfully written descriptions of the people and places of the time. 

And then...

> The Sleeping King is dead but dreaming.

Things take a somewhat supernatural turn. 

This is another of those cases where I put a book on my 'to read' list because it looked interesting and, before getting around to it, completely forgot it was going to be about. 

By the end... that took a much *darker* track than I was expecting[^expectations]... and that's starting from the point of view of racial disparity and violence in the 1920s.

And then... things get even darker. But I'll leave that for you to read. 

> Nobody ever thinks of himself as a villain, does he? Even monsters hold high opinions of themselves.

Overall, it's short. ~150 pages or a few hours audio. But I think it does a good job of hitting hard without overstaying it's welcome. If you're a fan of cosmic horror / weird fiction, I think you'll like it. I certainly did. 

Onward!

[^expectations]: I probably could have looked up my review of [[The Changeling]](), also by LaValle. I said much the same thing there. :smile:
