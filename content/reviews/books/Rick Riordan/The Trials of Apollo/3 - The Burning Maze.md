On one hand, the Apollo books are getting better. It's mostly more of the same, bringing myths to life in the real world combined with a constant sense of the world ending, but if that's what you're looking for ... power to you?  

And then there's a prophecy that  {{< spoiler >}}either Pipe or Jason{{< /spoiler >}}  is going to die. Of course you expect they'll figure out a way around it... Apollo is a (former?) god of prophecy after all? But madman that Riordan is, he actually does it. Ow. That was not at all what I expected to see in one of these books. Given the Doors of Death etc we've seen in these series, it's still possible they'll figure out a work around... but still. Wow.

Overall, it's a solid book and really makes me like the Apollo series more. Pity the next one isn't out yet. Guess I'll get around to that when it comes out.
