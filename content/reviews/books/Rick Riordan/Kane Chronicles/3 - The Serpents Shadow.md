A solid ending to the series. Once again the world will end in _n_ days and it's up to Sadie and Carter to save that day.  

Really, it feels like the second half of The Throne of Fire. We have the same support characters, the same big bad, the same magic, and it doesn't feel like that terribly much time has passed. Honestly, it's not a bad thing; it's just a little bit weird.

One thing I did like is that the climactic battle did actually feel big. It was a bit rushed, but it was nice to see everything coming together in a bunch of ways. The afterwards with the gods withdrawing was odd, but made sense. There there was a paragraph or two dedicated to setting the stage for a potential Percy Jackson crossover. I mentioned in a previous review: it's neat to think about, but I'm not sure how well it could be done.  

So far as downsides, really the same as the previous two books. The meta story of being a transcription of an audio recording is weird. I sometimes couldn't tell which sibling I was reading. But it felt a little less bad this time around. Perhaps I just got used to it?  

As I've said before: the series isn't quite as good as either the Greek or Roman series, but stand alone it's still certainly enjoyable. I'm glad I read them.
