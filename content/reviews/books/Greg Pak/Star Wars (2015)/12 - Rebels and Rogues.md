> All of our lives, we have fought this war. Tonight I believe we can end it. Tonight is not an accident. There are no accidents. We have not come here by chance. I do not believe in chance. When I see three objectives, three captains, three ships. I do not see coincidence, I see providence. I see purpose. I believe it our fate to be here. It is our destiny. I believe this night holds for each and every one of us, the very meaning of our lives.

Wait. No. Wrong franchise.

It doesn’t help when that’s their disguise garb. 

Luke’s off to lure some imperial probes away, Han and Leia are going to try to trick criminals (and perhaps an old ex) into fighting a war for them, and Chewie and C-3PO? Well, they have a planet to blow up. 

What could possibly go wrong?

A thrilling… part one!

This comic came out a year after Solo.

And Rogue One was two years before that. 

Also, I love this scene:
