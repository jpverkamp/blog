And now everyone’s back together for one giant showdown. Champions, rock monsters, and all!

It’s all quite exciting in all the best science fantasy sorts of ways Star Wars has to offer!

Quite a way to end this particular series. Whatever could be next?!

Poe, eh?

A preview of Star Wars #1! As of that wasn’t confusing. 

Also [[Star Wars: Darth Vader (2015)]](), Doctor Aphra, Target Vader, Han Solo: Imperial Cadet. 

Such a bunch of series to read!
