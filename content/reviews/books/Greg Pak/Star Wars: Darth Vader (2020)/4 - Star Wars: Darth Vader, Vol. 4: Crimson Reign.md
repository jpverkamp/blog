All right. 

So forget Luke and Han Vader is apparently going after this Crimson Dawn now.

Except:

They’re everywhere. 

Should be right up Vader’s alley. 

Add to that the return of Sabe. It’s an unexpectedly interesting way to tie into Vader’s past. One just had to wonder if/*when* she’ll learn the truth of Vader’s identity…

Still not quite as good as the first two volumes but an enjoyable read nevertheless. 

On thing I particularly enjoy about the comics is just how varied and alien the universe can feel:

It’s a nice contrast to how human centric the movies and shows have to be. Easier to draw a bug/lizard/ten foot ball droid than to put them on film.
