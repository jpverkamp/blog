title: 'Darth Vader, Vol. 1: Dark Heart of the Sith'
---

Darth Vader, shortly after Luke escapes him in The Empire Strikes Back. Realizing that perhaps he doesn’t actually *know* what happened to Padme. 

Off to trawl through the past. With… quite the droid.

It’s a fascinating look into Vader forced to dig into Anakin’s past. On Tattoine. On—and under—Naboo. Work the Handmaidens and other from Padme’s life. 

A fascinating mix. I’m curious where it goes next!

Side note: I can’t imagine reading these issue by issue… dang that’s a cliffhanger in issue 1…
