title: 'Darth Vader, Vol. 6: Return of the Handmaidens'

The Handmaidens. Hired to look like Padme; now they’re impersonating one another.

Good times. Silly names. But that’s Star Wars for you. 

<!--more-->

It’s kind of weird to have this whole group of women who’s entire personality seems based on their service to a young Queen who has been dead for decades (?) at this point. 

There are hints of more, sure. But it’s still frustrating to read. 

Overall, it’s fine. But Ochi and the Handmaidens make for a weaker Vader storyline. Onward!

Random cool scene of the day:
