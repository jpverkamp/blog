Vader is after Solo now…

With some interesting “allies”.

Plus an appearance by the one and only (I assume) IG-88!

Coolest part:

Vader getting ~~hacked~~ sliced! He’s ‘more machine now than man’ so it fits. They could have done so much more with it…

The introduction (for me at least) of the Crimson Dawn is interesting as well. A Million Stronger than One. A neat idea to contrast the ‘only two there are’ Sith and the Big Damn Heroes of the Rebellion. 

A bit more out there than the previous two volumes but I enjoyed it.

A Hutt with *serious* abs. Yo.
