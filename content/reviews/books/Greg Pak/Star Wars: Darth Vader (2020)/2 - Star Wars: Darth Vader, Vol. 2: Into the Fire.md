Vader learned Luke was his son… and ran off across the Galaxy, tracking down anyone he could that might have hidden the truth from him.

The Emperor was not thrilled. 

So he tears Vader apart over again, sends him  back to Mustafar (planet of his both in a way), and forbids him the force. 

Things only get more epic from here. 

It’s a whirlwind of Vader passing test after trial, showing off just why he’s one of the most powerful beings in the Galaxy. Until we return to Exegol—2 years after the Rise of Skywalker; trying to fill in some of the mess that one made of continuity. 

Vader is a weird choice for a protagonist, but likewise weirdly compelling. He is (at this point) unabashedly evil, yet I find myself rooting for him. 

Worth a read.

Star Wars gets weird sometimes. 

And it gets weirder than *that*.
