It seems the Handmaidens freed a number of former slaves from Tattooine. Including some familiar very minor characters from episode 1. 

A great way to… blackmail Vader into doing a good thing?

For all Vader touts order over chaos… he certainly does have a flair for shaking things up. 

Also: an ‘artificial life force draining storm’ is so very Star Wars sounding. 

It’s a fine story. Interesting to see the complexity Vader is struggling with even now/then.
