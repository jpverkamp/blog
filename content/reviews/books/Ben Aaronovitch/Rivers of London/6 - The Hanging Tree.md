title: The Hanging Tree

> Jeremy Beaumont-Jones had been lucky enough to be born rich. He wasn’t in the mad oligarch class but once you’re past a certain point, the sheer weight of your money sucks in wealth like a financial singularity. If you’re sensible enough not to blow it on race horses, cocaine or musical theatre, then it becomes a perpetual-motion money making machine.

The power of money--and those with power of their own, which tends to lead to money in it's own ways. 

And Peter getting caught right up to it, a favor called in. 

It's a whole mess of the posh/upper class world of London and all the problems that come with this--and how much they expect to be able to pay their way out of anything. 

> It took the Fire Brigade a day and a half to secure the remains of the house enough to recover Crew Cut’s body, which was described by Dr Jennifer Vaughan as ‘suffering from crush trauma’ and by Dr Walid as ‘mostly flat’.

Well. Almost anything. 

I enjoy seeing more of Guleed, both in her role as a cop but also her getting more into the magical world--at least by proxy. 

It's fascinating to see more of Lesley. That's such a mess throughout all of these books--and I really don't know where we're going from there. 

And to finally face off more literally face to face with the Faceless Man? Awesome. 

The plots and sudden resolutions continue in this book. At this point, I'm mostly used to it... but only mostly. 

Side note:

> Once the telephone had been invented, it was only a matter of time before the police got in on the new technology and, first in Glasgow and then in London, the police box was born. Here a police officer in need of assistance could find a telephone link to Scotland Yard, a dry space to do “paperwork” and, in certain extreme cases, a life of adventure through space and time.

That's delightful.
