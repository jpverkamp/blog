Ghosts! Goblins! Murder! The FBI (in London)! The LONDON UNDERGROUND!

I do continue to really love the feel of these books. It *feels* like a British cop show with a combination of magical elements and the science of magic, which are all delightful things. 

Characterwise, it's mostly the same, although this time around, we get a lot more of Lesley stepping up to learn magic again, which is something I was hoping would happen. I'm looking forward to seeing how those two grow together. 

> "That was Seawoll," she said. "Stephanopoulos is on her way down and you’re not to do anything stupid until she gets here."
> 
> You burn down one central London tourist attraction, I thought, and they never let you forget it.

It's also interesting seeing the bits of London as a city built on people from all manners, histories, and walks of life. 

> My mum translated this in her head to "witchfinder," which was good because like most West Africans, she considered witchfinding a more respectable profession than policeman.

:smile:

Worldbuildingwise, I like seeing ever more of teh magical world of London. There really is a feel of 'this *could* be' that urban fantasy doesn't always get right. And I enjoy finding out that even the magical folks don't know how a lot of what they do works, but our main character is *not* going to let that stand. 

> This is why magic is worse even than quantum physics. Because, while both spit in the eye of common sense, I've never yet had a Higgs bosun turn up and try to have a conversation with me.

It's fun to see even more of the magical underground (literally). It's neat to see how different authors play with old stories (and make up their own!)

> “My dad was a fairy," said Zach. "And by that I don't mean he dressed well and enjoyed musical theatre.” 

One oddity: There are a ton of Lord of the Rings references throughout this book, some blatent and some more subtle. I was really fully expecting that to [[wiki:Chekhov's gun]]()... but they were just references all along? That seems weird to me and I can't quite my finger on why. 

Overall, I loved it and am looking forward to the next one! Onward!

Aside; favorite line of the book?

> I saw a dark void under the platform and had just enough time to think: "Fuck me he's a earthbender.”
