The Faceless Man on the run--and trying to ring in[^bell] some new form of chaos to bring London to its knees. 

Along the way, we'll bump into new characters and, even better, fill in a few more holes in the histories of others. Each step we get closer to Molly's tale is well appreciated. 

And man. Lesley has some trauma to work through. I love the fact that she's not completely evil and off the deep end, but trying desperately (in her own way) to do the right thing. 

I'll admit, it's a little strange to see how integrated the entire magical world is getting into the London police force. Rather than just Peter and Nightingale against the world, they have backup. But... is it still secret or isn't it? It's in that weird 'magic is still secret' category of hard to believe. Which stands all the more out as I'm also reading [[Dead Witch Walking]]().

This entire series remains a master class in 'what in the world is actually going on' endings. There's the whole show-don't-tell (mis)advice writers always get, but when you show a fever dream of a battle scene and leave it at that[^bev]... Well, perhaps just a *little* bit of telling wouldn't go amiss? 

Still enjoying the series. This feels like the potential close to one arc[^fake]... so what's next[^baby]?

Onward!

[^bell]: Ring in, get it? No? Read the book! :smile:

[^bev]: Proto-Bev in this scene was kind of hilarious. I have no idea if 'Bev' is a singular being that has had different forms over the years or if they live with a different relationship to time or if this battle scene was both in the present but based on the past or what. But that was quite an amusing scene. 

[^fake]: Totally a cop (heh) out death though; they even call this one out in the story. 

[^baby]: Oh final page cliffhangers. (Spoilers if you go read the source for this post I suppose :smile: But come on...)
