> It all started when Dr Brian Robertson, retired GP, enthusiastic amateur ecologist and self-confessed cryptid aficionado, stumbled over a dead sheep a few kilometres west of the town of Mintlaw, Aberdeenshire. Normally, because they are famously geniuses at finding inventive ways of getting themselves killed, a dead sheep does not cause much concern beyond irritation in the farmer and speculation as to whether it can be disposed of off the books to avoid costs.

That is most certainly an opening paradox. 

So here we are. Caught up (for now). 

With Peter Grant (and family) on vacation in Scotland (but not really). It's interesting having the change of view--given how much the 'London'ness of Rivers of London made the series--right up there along with the 'magical cop' half of the stories. But I liked it; it's fun having Peter and co on an adventure and out of their element. 

> How’re you going to lure it down?’ he asked. ‘Birdseed, chips, a nice fresh herring?’

> ‘Since we’re looking for a magic bird,’ I said, ‘I’m going to lure it down with magic.’

> Blinschell stared at me for a whole minute. As police, you learn to be almost as good a liar as any random grifter or multinational CEO, so it said something that I read every expression as it passed across his face. Suspicion … Is he taking the piss? Are the rumours true? No, I’m fairly certain he’s taking the piss. But what if he isn’t? You hear stories. Yeah, stories, right. Rumours, more like, because that’s reliable …

Well. Sort of out of his element. :smile:

We have Abigail all grown up (and with her own point of view chapters, that was surprising; also, with her own romance subplot, which is ... odd, mostly in contrast with Peter's point of view we've had up until now) and the twins already old enough to be talking. And of course causing chaos along the way. 

Oh, and all manner of sea people and creatures. 

Downright cthulian that. 

It's a fun book. And it's weird to be caught up!

Onward.
