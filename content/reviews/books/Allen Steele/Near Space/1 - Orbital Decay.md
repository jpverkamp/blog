This took me a while to get through. It's not because it's bad, more like it just feels a bit dated.  

Basically, it's a circa 1990 story about just how boring life as a glorified construction worker in space could be. Basically, if you're into hard science fiction that doesn't glamorize space and all that involves, this could be your book.

On the other hand, I'd personally recommend the Coyote Trilogy over this.  

That's really about all I have to say about Orbital Decay. So it goes.
