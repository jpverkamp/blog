title: The Magician's Land

> It didnâ€™t matter where you were, if you were in a room full of books you were at least halfway home.

In [[The Magicians]](), we had half Harry Potter *but cynical* and half Narnia... *but cynical*. In [[The Magician King]](), we mostly stuck around in Fillory (the Narnia analogue). But right at the end... our well loved (:sarcasm:) main character Quentin pays the ultimate price: he doesn't get to hang out in the magical land anymore and has to go home. 

The Magician's Land picks up from there, with one plot following Quentin as he settles back into a normal life, becomes a teacher, promptly gets fired, and descends to a life of crime. As one does. 

On the other hand, we have the (new and improved?) Kings and Queens of Fillory dealingw ith their own sort of armageddon. Turns out saving magic... wasn't enough?

Overall, it's a solid book. It wraps up all manner character arcs and plotlines in a way you don't often get. We even get some conclusion for Alice, which isn't something that I was actually expecting at this point. I'm not a huge fan of where that went, but it was still good to see. 

A solid conclusion and worth the read if you already read the first two. 

Onward!

> It was funny how just when you thought you knew yourself through and through, you stumbled on a new kind of strength, a fresh reserve of power inside you that you never knew you had, and all at once you found yourself burning a little brighter and hotter than you ever had before.

Side note: The idea that whales are magical and they're keeping something *big* suppressed under the ocean? I want *that* story now.
