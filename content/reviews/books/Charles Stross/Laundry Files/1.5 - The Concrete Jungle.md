I liked this even better than The Atrocity Archives.  

The idea of SCORPION STARE (Medusa, weaponized) is neat and there's some interesting commentary on the potential problems of a surveillance state that fit well with the overall Britishness of the piece.  

<!--more-->

One advantage this has over the Atrocity Archives is that Stross toned down the technobabble a little bit. Don't get me wrong, I think that uninhibited geekery is one of the better parts of these books, but it got intense at times. In this one it's more manageable--probably since it's only about half the length. Of course, to some extent, the technobabble is replaced by spybabble. But those I don't know nearly as well, which amusingly makes it less distracting.  

One semi-issue this had was the the same oddities with timing that the first did: in that I didn't quite expect it to end as quickly as it did. I don't have any particular problem with how they were wrapped it, it was just sudden. I think I've been reading too many long books recently.
