Another short story between the second and third Laundry Files novels, this one goes into detail on exactly how weird unicorns can be in a fantasy universe.  

Turns out: pretty weird.  

<!--more-->

There is a bit more actual horror, including body horror and children, in this one. It might be a little more problematic for people that are reading this for the light horror the other novels possess thus far.  

One interesting aspect of this story is subsections purportedly taken from a letter written by HP Lovecraft himself. The style is very different, and makes an interesting counterpart to Stross' normal style.  

Still, I continue to like the world building and character of Bob. It's nice reading short stories in a universe I already know and know there is more in.
