That... was intense.  

To really get the most out of this book, I think you'd have to have a certain combination of things in your head: a knowledge of a lot of the more esoteric bits of computer science theory, physics, pop culture, and cosmic horrors. Pretty much right up my alley. Even then, I will admit to having no idea exactly where he was going with a few of those.

It's entirely possible that you'll still like it, even without the same base knowledge. It's still a quick enough read, with enough action to keep you turning the page, even if some of the technical info dumps are probably going to get skipped.  

The last bit spent in the other world was fascinating. From a purely academic / world building standpoint, I would love to be able to see how such an alternate universe would deal with the sun going out and the air seeping away. How long would people survive? How would they deal with the beastie making it all happen?  

After this, I am definitely going to read the rest of the Laundry Files.
