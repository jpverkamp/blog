title: Things in the Basement
---
Another children's graphic novel in the vein of [[Mighty Jack]]() and [[Little Robot]](). Just like those, it's a delight to read and I truly think a great way to get children into reading more!

Storywise, it's all about those basements that are used for storage, chock full of who knows what--which is exactly the point. *Anything* could be down there. A missing sock. A rat leading you on adventures. Spooky creatures and giant slimes. 

Who knows?!

:smile:

Man it's a fun book and beautifully drawn. 

Worth a read.
