It's adorable!  

One of my children brought it over to read. On one hand, it's a difficult book to read--there's not much in the way of words for most of the book. On the other hand, most of the words there are are crazy robot sounds, which are a lot of fun to make! And I expect the lower number of words is going to make it all the easier for my children as they get more comfortable reading themselves.

Well worth the read.
