A solid book.

Take a bit of magic/folklore in an oldentimes Ireland; add in a Fae bargain (with all the complications that ensues); combine with a prince and princess who've never met outside of letters--and seem entirely different in person; and finish it all off with fairy tale magic of Dreamer's Pool. 

<!--more-->

The characters are fun and really seel the story--I like the prickly/going to do the right thing Blackthorn complicated with the seemingly straight forward, but deeper than you'd think thug Grim. Oran, trying to be a good prince until he's right up against the real world. 

The plot is fairly fairy tale (which I enjoyed) and feels a touch incomplete (less so). The smaller plots are more than finished, but you can see there's room for the sequels. 

The setting is medieval (earlier?) Ireland. It's as magical as that land has always felt, but nothing particularly new or interesting. It does feel more the scale of the world back then--kingdoms stretched miles/a few days' journey, not over entire continents. A village or two and the surrounding lands is all that matters to most people's entire lives. I kind of like it. 

Overall, a great read. I'm looking forward to the sequels. Give it a try. 

Random side note:

> ‘A wish? Why would I want a wish?’ “‘ Riches,’ croaked the dying salmon. ‘A sweetheart. Admiration. Nobility. Happiness. A new cottage for your old mother. How would I know what you might want? I’m a fish.’

This line cracked me up. It's a tale in a tale, the myth of catching a magical talking fish. Who's apparently snarky.
