title: The Never Tilting World

Well that's a lot of world building. Start with elemental magic, nothing *super* new there (although acid is always a fun one). Add in an ancient prophecy and twins where only one can rule. Still not that unusual. 

And then defy the prophecy and *literally stop the world spinning*, leaving one side a desert scorched by a never ending noon, the other frozen in perpetual night. 

> We’re chasing a dying sea under an endless sun that kills us with a thousand little cuts every day. There’ll be nothing left soon. Nothing but sand and bone.

Now that's pretty cool worldbuilding, especially for a fantasy world (it's something you see slightly more in sci-fi). 

Now on top of that, you have a ruler in each world, each with a daughter. Well, you can guess what probably happened and who these two are (remember those twins I mentioned?), but none of them know that. 

So you get a fascinating ride as each realized just how screwed up their own corner of the world is, falls in love (there is more than a touch of romance in this book)...

> If the choice is between me risking my life and losing you, I’d choose the first.

...and sets off on a journey to set things right. 

> When the dead find words, the goddess and the Devoted son will meet atop a fish not a fish, on a sea not a sea. It is she who travels to the endless Abyss, and it is he who guides her.

I quite enjoyed this book. It takes a bit of getting into and the leads are... more than a touch Young Adult/'chosen one'ish, but it's still a fun read/listen. 

Onward!
