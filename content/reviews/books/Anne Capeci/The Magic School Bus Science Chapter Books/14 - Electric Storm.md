Did you know they made Magic School bus chapter books? (And did you know my son randomly chose #14 to start at?)

They're basically those vibrant kids' science books, writ large. Still with plenty of illustrations, scientific asides, and more child endangerment than you can shake a lightning bolt at. 

This time around (as one might expect :smile:), the Friz and class end up getting swept up into a lightning storm, shrink down to the size of electrons, and *become lightning*. 

How cool. 

It's a quick read, a fun adventure, and I have no problems with the science presented. I'm going to have to find a few more of these to read with my son!

Onward!
