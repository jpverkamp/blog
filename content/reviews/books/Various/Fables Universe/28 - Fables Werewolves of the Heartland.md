Another side story (there are only a few of these), digging a bit deeper into Bigby's past, specifically during World War II (which we'd already seen) and some of the unforseen fallout from that.

Because of course there's a town full of secret Naziish Werewolves in the middle of America. Of course.  

And of course they worship Bigby ( **THE** Big Bad Wolf himself) as a god.

It's a solid story and a nice interlude, although the timing of the story (while the Mr. Dark plotline is still going on) is a bit strange.  

Also, so very much nudity. Naked werewolves are quite a bit more ... naked when they're in a visual medium such as a graphic novel. Sometimes furry, sometimes not. You have been warned.  

One random fun comment, I really did love the the 'how the story came to be' quote at the end:  

> I stopped in at the Happy Chef Restaurent, on Board Street, found a nice > table, and ordered an open-faced turkey sandwich, a Coke and a sotry.  
>
> "Excuse me?" the waitress said.  
>
> I repeated my order.  
>
> "A story?" she said. "I don't understand."  
>
> "Isn't this Story City?" I said. "So, along with lunch, I'll be wanting my > story."  
>
> "Oh," she said. Then, after an extended pause, "No one's ever asked that > before."  
>
> Our enjoyable back and forth banter went on for a spell, until the Happy > Chef's manager explain that Story City was so named not because was a near > magical place of wonderful stories for the asking, but after the famous > Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, 1779-1845. Of course, I should've > thought of that.  

I love it. And you know what, there's a whole mine of story seeds right there. Perhaps it isn't a town full of werewolves, but somehow otherly magical all on it's own!
