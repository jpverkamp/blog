{{< goodreads book="Cinderella: Fables are Forever" >}} in a nutshell:  

![Cinderella-2-01](/embeds/books/attachments/cinderella-2-01.jpg)  

<!--more-->

Basically, it's the story of Secret Agent Cinderella and her rivalry with her 'dark' counterpoint: Dorthy of Oz. Because of course.  

Man it's a crazy ride. A touch of spy versus spy, a touch of Fables magic, and a touch of girl power all blended up into an outright rediculous (and yet fun) story.

Spoons. Oz is weird.  

That is all.
