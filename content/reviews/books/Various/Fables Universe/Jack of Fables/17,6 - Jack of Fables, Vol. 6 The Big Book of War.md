More Jack! And this it's the big battle schene in this universe, much like in {{< goodreads book="Fables, Vol. 11: War and Pieces" text=" Fables, Vol. 11: War and Pieces " >}} . Gary (the Pathetic Fallacy) really shines here:

No horses? Use anything close!

IT LIVES!  

And of course as comedic relief the entire time as well:

It's a bit telling just how strange the Literals are and also  {{< spoiler >}}quite the twist for Jack to be half Literal{{< /spoiler >}}  .  

Wait. What does that mean for John of Fables? Where'd he go anyways?
