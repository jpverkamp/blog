So far as Jack stories, this was one pretty week. Americana is interesting, and the idea that zombies are both a huge part of life, but completely integrated certainly means... something?  

I'm intrigued by the idea of one of the Page sisters along for the ride and man all the family relationships being revealed are pretty crazy.  

<!--more-->

But other than that, there's just not much to it.  

Still worth it for completion sake I guess? I'm ready to go back to the mainline.  

Spoilers and screenshots (only two, that should tell you something):

I like her. She's a fun one.

Oh Jack. Also... _"I don't have a penis"_. That is all.
