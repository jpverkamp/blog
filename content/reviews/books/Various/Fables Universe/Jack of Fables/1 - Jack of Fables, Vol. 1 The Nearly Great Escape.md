Oh that's a turn of phrase.  

<!--more-->

So I've decided that I'm going to read the Fables serieses(sp?) in published order, with a bit of jumping around. That includes:  

{{< goodreads series="Fables (Collected Editions)" text="Fables" >}}   {{< goodreads series="Jack of Fables" >}}   {{< goodreads series="Cinderella" >}}   {{< goodreads series="Fairest (Collected Editions)" text="Fairest" >}}  

All combined into the overall {{< goodreads series="Fables +" text="Fables Universe" >}}.  

For the first outing, {{< goodreads book="Jack of Fables, Vol. 1: The" text="Jack of Fables, Vol. 1: The (Nearly) Great Escape" >}} is quite a story. After the events of {{< goodreads book="Fables, Vol. 6: Homelands" >}}, Jack is on the run, only to be captured by some sort of Men in Black feeling organization that wants to do study and depower Fables. Cool concept, kind of terrifying execution. And hey, Goldilocks survived after all. Called that.  

It's a crazy wonderful tale and I'm glad I read it here. Makes sense before everything continues to go mad.

That is quite the character. Beauty and the Beast eat your heart out.  

Even more so when they go to escape:

It's a (temporarily) sentient fence.

Egg-based life. That is all. Also Goldilocks be very very strange.

And then you get the downright Lovecraftian Bag Men. I want to know more about that...
