And now we return you to our regularly scheduled Jack of the Fables, where things are getting increasinly weirdly meta.

You know... it kind of works. Especially when it's not crossing over with the main Fables storyline any more.  

Standing alone, it's not the best of the Jack stories, but it's got some interesting potential at least (once you get through it). And more weird Jack backstory!

Plus, hey. The authors get to make a crack about how all humans look the same to them. :D
