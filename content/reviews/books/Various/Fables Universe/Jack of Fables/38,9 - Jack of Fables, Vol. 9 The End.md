Oy. Jack of Fables should probably have ended back with {{< goodreads book="Jack of Fables, Vol. 6: The Big Book of War" text=" Jack of Fables, Vol. 6: The Big Book of War " >}} . It wrapped up everything nicely enough. Instead it just keeps going. But here, we have a finale! Except...  {{< spoiler >}}everyone dies{{< /spoiler >}}  Not even kidding. After we've come to know and love all these characters, the big finale is them all getting together for one last battle ... and every one of them  {{< spoiler >}}dies{{< /spoiler >}}  . I guess that's one way to end a series.  

Sucks.

Heh. It's funny because dragon. I guess. Why does Gary stick around with him?  

The sections with this art style are at least pretty amusing, specifically because of the style.

Woo Page sisters. Who for some reason are carrying around a baby? When did that happen? And then the baby is sent to his father, never to be seen again.

Oh right. John. He's still around. Only to  {{< spoiler >}}die{{< /spoiler >}}  like everyone else.  

That was kind of a bummer ending to what was never my favorite of the Fables series. So it goes. Onward and back to Fairest and the mainline for the last few!
