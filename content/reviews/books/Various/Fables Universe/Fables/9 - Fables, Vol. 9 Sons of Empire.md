[[Fables, Vol. 9: Sons of Empire]](). The calm before the storm. It's a number of somewhat lighter tales (relatively speaking!) showing how both sides are preparing to strike back.  

We get a bit more detail on Frau Totenkinder--who turns out to be even more than we thought--and Ambrose/Flycatcher, who seems to have quite the backstory. And of course, the Wolf clan. They're always a lot of fun.

A good story. A nice breather.  

Onwards!  

Some of my favorite scenes (spoilers):  

![Fables-9-01-Inquisitor-General-Hansel](/embeds/books/attachments/fables-9-01-inquisitor-general-hansel.jpg)  

The idea that Hansel is on the side of the Adversary is ... of course he is. Especially given that Frau Totenkinder is who she is.  

![Fables-9-02-The-power-behind-the-scenes](/embeds/books/attachments/fables-9-02-the-power-behind-the-scenes.jpg)  

It's on one hand amazing that the average person doesn't know. But I guess that's entirely the point of the thing.  

![Fables-9-03-POOF](/embeds/books/attachments/fables-9-03-poof.jpg)  

Man, Fly's had a rough life. Stress? Frog. Wife? Dead. Family? Dead. Oof.  

![Fables-9-04-Rapunzel](/embeds/books/attachments/fables-9-04-rapunzel.jpg)  

The idea of curses carrying on was one we saw before with Briar Rose, but this makes it all the better. Three haircuts a day. And she's making bank on it. Pretty cool.  

![Fables-9-05-Three-blind-mice](/embeds/books/attachments/fables-9-05-three-blind-mice.jpg)  

A silly little version of the Three Blind Mice. It works.  

![Fables-9-06-Santa](/embeds/books/attachments/fables-9-06-santa.jpg)  

If you stay up to catch Santa, you can have one true answer instead of your presents. I really like that idea. And you know, that's actually a really good way that Santa works. Magic.  

![Fables-9-07-One-last-kiss](/embeds/books/attachments/fables-9-07-one-last-kiss.jpg)  

Santa's gift for Fly: one last kiss.  

Man. Right in the feels. He's got quite a story.  

![Fables-9-08-Geppetto-is-a-terrible-father](/embeds/books/attachments/fables-9-08-geppetto-is-a-terrible-father.jpg)  

You know. Geppetto really is kind of a terrible father figure. I feel bad for how Pinocchio has been stuck there.  

![Fables-9-09-Glasshole](/embeds/books/attachments/fables-9-09-glasshole.jpg)  

Heh. Glasshole. Also the idea that everyone rhymes to magic mirror, but you don't actually *have* to, it just likes it? That's funny.  

![Fables-9-10-Fiftheenth-birthday](/embeds/books/attachments/fables-9-10-fiftheenth-birthday.jpg)  

All that before he was fifteen. Man Charming is morally all over the place. He tries to do good, but ... he is who he is.
