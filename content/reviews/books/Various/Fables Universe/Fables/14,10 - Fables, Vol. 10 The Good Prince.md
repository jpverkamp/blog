{{< goodreads book="Fables, Vol. 10: The Good Prince" text=" Fables, Vol. 10: The Good Prince " >}} . The story of Ambrose (Flycatcher).  

In a nut shell:  {{< spoiler >}}he finds the ghost of Lancelot (yes, that Lancelot), Excaliber (yes, that Excaliber), saves a bunch of damned Fable souls, and makes a kingdom where anyone who wants to sit out the coming war can be safe{{< /spoiler >}}  . If you'd have said that was his coming storyline when we first met him, I'd have thought you mad.

It's kind of a crazy escalation of power, but for Fly it actually really works. He's a fun character. And as powered us as he is, I don't think we have to worry much about him 'breaking' things in the coming war.  

A powerful story.  

Cool scenes and spoilers ahoy:

Boy Blue telling him this is such an interesting idea. He's really quiet the vetern for all he still looks like a boy. And he has a point. All the magic in the world can't stop a large enough army.

Huh. So {{< goodreads book="Jack of Fables, Vol. 1: The" text=" Jack of Fables, Vol. 1: The (Nearly) Great Escape " >}} goes here? Sure. It works.

The art style is weird, but the story is cute. I totally understand Bigby here. Six (seven) kids. Man.  

![Fables-10-04-Meeting-number-7](/embeds/books/attachments/fables-10-04-meeting-number-7.jpg)  

They're so adorably children. A spirit of wind... farts really good.  

![Fables-10-05-Two-powers](/embeds/books/attachments/fables-10-05-two-powers.jpg)  

Turns out it's all a proxy war between two crazy powerful individuals, even if they powers involved don't both know it yet. I wonder if she's full of it or if that's how it's actually going to come to be?  

![Fables-10-06-A-witch-s-backstory](/embeds/books/attachments/fables-10-06-a-witch-s-backstory.jpg)  

All of this, Fabletown and their resistance having a chance, comes from the kindness Snow White and Rose Red showed to a woman then found burnt in an oven one time. Fascinating.  

![Fables-10-07-The-fly-show](/embeds/books/attachments/fables-10-07-the-fly-show.jpg)  

"Watching the Fly show" is such a funny idea. He's off building a kingdom in one of the most fantastic magical ways he could and they're all watching it on a magical TV.  

![Fables-10-08-Haven](/embeds/books/attachments/fables-10-08-haven.jpg)  

A neutral party of sorts, even if he did cut off a huge part of Geppetto's power once again. I wonder if Geppetto will try to invade (again) and bring Fly back into the war.  

![Fables-10-09-The-fly-show-continued](/embeds/books/attachments/fables-10-09-the-fly-show-continued.jpg)  

_Previously on... the Fly Show_  

![Fables-10-10-Flycatcher](/embeds/books/attachments/fables-10-10-flycatcher.jpg)  

Playing Flycatcher. That really does put it in perspective. He's become a Fable among the Fables now.
