Fables feels like it's been running for perhaps a bit too long. And things are certainly not Happily Ever After...  

Bigby is back... ish.  

<!--more-->

Rose Red and Snow White are still at each other's throats, but at least we finally get a reason for why. Except why that wouldn't possibly have come up before now hurts it somewhat.  

Jack... exists. Ish.  

Ms. Spratt/Douglas is growing more and more Dark. Ish.  

A lot of ish. I really fell more like they had to come up with one last conflict to finish off the series. I don't know if they didn't intend to run this long or what.  

It's still a fun read and interesting enough, but it doesn't quite measure up to where I hoped the series would be 21 (39 with subseries) issues in.  

So it goes.  

Spoilers (also NSFW):

Magical dream time! So of course... no clothes?  

![Fables-21-2](/embeds/books/attachments/fables-21-2.jpg)  

Backstory of Rose Red/Snow White's mother! Apparently they always have daughters and they always kill each other? Bizarre.  

![Fables-21-3](/embeds/books/attachments/fables-21-3.jpg)  

Jack and Gary interlude! Tacos! A better conclusion than {{< goodreads book="Jack of Fables, Vol. 9: The End" >}}?
