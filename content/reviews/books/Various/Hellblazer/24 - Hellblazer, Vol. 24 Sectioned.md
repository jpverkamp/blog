Well that’s unexpected. Epiphany is pretty cool… but she’s way too young for him. Still, demons, time travel, a succubus, demon blood transfusion slaves, a wedding or two? A good volume.

Thoughts while reading (spoilers):

## Sectioned

Oh Constantine. That’s a start. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-24-56c467.png)

Nope. **That’** a start.

Things only escalate from there. A mental ward, a new old friend with a Technicolor madness coat. Good times.

Growing up.

Like… a literal alien? I feel like I missed something. 

## Bloody Carnations

Constantine proposing… doesn’t make much sense. But of course it has to go badly for him. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-24-5a2cf8.png)

Interesting. I wonder if that’s how they deal with the Constantine age gap. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-24-972525.png)

Hah. Figured that was coming. Wonderful. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-24-59319e.png)

Did not expect that to work… Let alone twice. 

## City of Demons

Uh oh. This is going to end badly. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-24-1a8412.png)

Yup. Constantine demon blood slaves. Good times.

Meddling with things they don’t understand. 

When did this happen?
