Weird, slow, and dark at first but then we get the Deadly Habits storyline. That’s one of the core Constantine storylines so far as I know and for good reason. 

## The Bogeyman
Oh Constantine. What is going on with you. Dark and depressing and little happening. Sets up a story I suppose.

## Dead-Boy’s Heart 
That’s a great issue. Took me a bit to realize it was typing Constantine. So he’s always been … a little different.

Interesting how stories grow. An old man with likely mental issues living alone in the quarry to the Boogeyman . 

> But the very **worst** thing is—once you know it—**you’re** a Boogeyman too.   

## The Undiscover’d Country
To paraphrase the Bard:

So it’d going to be one of those weird, psychedelic, out of body stories then?

Visually fascinating at least. Dark echoes of a Christmas Story. A future now less than a decade away.

The dream ones are always weird. 

## Man’s War / Boy’s Game
An introduction to Martin—and a bloody disgusting one at that. And that’s before you even get to the butchery. 

### Man’s War
Wow. An overly manly man butcher dad and his disappointment in a more humane sin—and Mercury has gotten herald, Marj, and Constantine brown down right on their doorstep. 

Butchery (of pigs) and brutal people. A fascinating part one. 

### Boy’s Game
Bloody hazing and Mercury to save the day. 

Just… how in the world is she going to explain that to Marj and Constantine…

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-5-898b71.png)

Oy. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-5-d6e3b5.png)

Yeah okay. Literally snickered at that one. 

A solid story. 

## The Hanged Man / The Magus
A solid and very very weird two parter…

### The Hanged Man

Tarot in a world with Power. I haven’t quite got an feel for this version of Zed versus the movie or TV show ones. 

Flashbacks to Constantine’s birth:

And now we know what Mercury meant about killing his brother. Oy. Dark that. 

### The Magus
And then a story of what might have been. It’s an interesting story, but I’m not sure we’ve quite earned it having just learned about the brother.

Such a weird yet fascinating universe. 

## Dangerous Habits
Ah. Here begins the cancer storyline. I didn’t think that was solely a movie creation. 

### The Beginning of the End

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-5-0f3ce7.png)

All the  crazy things he’s done, and it will be came to kill him? I expect not. But how?

### A Drop of the Hard Stuff 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-5-7de5ba.png)

Yeah okay. It’s a silly scene and his friend is certainly well into drinking himself to death. But that’s hilarious. 

Water into… Beer!

Of course… it’s not long to last. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-5-4ece4a.png)

Yeah… Interesting way to go, but if you’re doomed anyways I suppose. And it gets better!

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-5-a5e00e.png)

A wonderful twist. And a chance for Constantine?

… oh that’s delightful. 

### Friends in High Places

One option:

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-5-3e564f.png)

Gabriel. Which of course goes purely. 

### My Way

A who’s who of meeting up and saying goodbye. Constantine style. Before one (hopefully not) last trick.

### The Sting

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-5-59d9ea.png)

And there it is. Oh boy. That’s a delightful trick. Not likely to work more than once, but once is enough…

### Falling into Hell

One heck of a story.
