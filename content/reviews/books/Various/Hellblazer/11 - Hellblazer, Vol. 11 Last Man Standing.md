A solid one. Big stories are interesting, little ones are touching_weird_sweet, and Constantineâ€™s got some new people and problems to deal with. Nothing too surreal either, which I appreciate. 

Mini-reviews (spoilers):

## Days of Wine and Roses
A little bit of Constantine, a little bit of regular human terror.

## The Wild Hunt

Oh my. 

Also: Colts!

## Last Man Standing
Argue and his men as ancient immortals? Merlin as a dragon? Sign me up!

Painting God as imperfect and screwed up as the rest of us is controversial to say the least, but I find the idea fascinating. And it seems that the authors of Hellblazer tend to agree. ðŸ˜†

### Part One: a Different Kind of Tension

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-11-e0eb33.png)

Boom.  Boom. Boom. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-11-ee7d2c.png)

Oh Constantineâ€™s face. 

### Part Two: No More Heroes

But which is the actual plot?

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-11-327843.png)

Neither! MERLIN!

Constantine really does seem to get right in the middle of things.

Old beings fighting is a neat trope though. And itâ€™s not angels and demons this time! (Or is itâ€¦)

Especially given that they were apparently there almost at Creation and the Grail is involved. The latter is Arthurian I suppose. 

### Part Three: Human Punk

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-11-2ea94f.png)

â€¦ of course. 

Which then tends to go rather sideways: 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-11-b26050.png)

â€¦ so whatâ€™s in the box?

Oh my. 

### Part Four: Youâ€™re Just aâ€¦

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-11-fa0c7c.png)

**insert Austin Powers style head puns here**

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-11-2b55b1.png)

I love this. Thereâ€™s just so much you could do with this version of Arthur. And I bet it is only a short run. Still cool. 

### Part Five: No One is Innocent

A few pages of all the crazy terrible things Constantine has been through / mostly brought on himself. Oy. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-11-14195a.png)

â€¦ â€¦ â€¦ Iâ€™ve got nothing.

## In the Red Corner

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-11-e739cf.png)

Thatâ€™sâ€¦ saying something. Interesting. 

Gets much weirder before itâ€™s done though. 

## Widdershins

### Part One

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-11-8e4878.png)

Heâ€™s back! And so is ghostly trouble. 

### Part Two

â€¦ 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-11-37c893.png)

Thatâ€™s a jump. 

The final connection to the opening running scenes and the title thoughâ€¦ worth it. 

## Life and Death and Taxis 
Not a typo. 

Betty and a baby. Birth and death. 

A short, sweet story. 

## Undertow

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-11-c93965.png)

Oh Constantine. 

Sometimes, they they just canâ€™t be saved. 

## Desperately Seeking Something

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-11-8cdbb4.png)

Who? Me?

A fascinating story structure. And a nice place for a cameo too:

Dead guyâ€™s not wrong.

A neat one to end on.
