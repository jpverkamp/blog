Constantine lost and found and so very screwed. Literally. A lot happens in this one and there’s a lot of potential for what comes next. Looking forward to it.

## Staring at the Wall
The continuing story of the Shadow Dog and the Red Sepulchre.

Good times.

Cool detail.

And an excellent sense of scale.

Sneaky twist that. 

I wonder what the repercussions of the Green’s human soul are going to be… always consequences. 

## Ward 24

That’s a lot I’m to drop on him, all at once…

## Out of Season

Well one of them knows who he is!

Accidental or intentional, that’s hilarious. And quite a way to once again one up the assorted forces of Hell. 

Now… 24 hours. What could possibly go wrong?

## Happy Families
Oh now that…

…that is a nasty trick. 

Three lifetimes, three lives, all in one day. That’s got a lot of potential. 

## Event Horizons

A neat twist. Protection… but not for you, from itself.
