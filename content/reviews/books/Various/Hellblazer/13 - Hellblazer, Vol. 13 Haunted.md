One heck of a crazy longer story (Haunted, one of the best of that length) and a bunch of shorter ones, ranging from not much to really good. 

Mini-reviews and pretty pictures (spoilers):

## Haunted
That’s a story. Enough time to breathe, a cast of new and interesting story, and all sorts of gross and creepy scenes. 

### Part One

Oy. Although you can’t say she’s wrong. 

Murder scene description: oy that’s graphic. 

### Part Two

Oh boy. Map is an interesting one. Hope we see more of him. 

Another step along the journey. 

### Part Three

I think he might be on the right road… Takes a bit, but:

### Part Four 

More Map!

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-13-0eea26.png)

I… have no idea what exactly he just did, but go Map! (That was gross)

Still more steps forward. 

### Part Five

Where old magicians go to be dead. An interesting place. An interesting person. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-13-302ac5.png)

Huh. I didn’t expect that. 

### Part Six

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-13-f94a70.png)

Ah. That makes more sense. 

And then gets downright twisted. Eye for an eye, torture for torture? Oy. 

I wonder if he’ll be back…

## Locked

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-13-69012d.png)

The changing artists/styles remains jarring. I like this Constantine more than the chiseled jaw of Haunted though personally. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-13-f6d4f7.png)

Wooooow. 

Quick, self-contained, and twisted. I like it. 

## The Crib

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-13-608d92.png)

Well that’s certainly a bit of mythology…

Yet anther style too:

And then:

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-13-fb116a.png)

I’m… not even sure sometimes. The idea of the crib fits in Constantine’s world… but so does—this. Oy. 

## Setting Sun

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-13-d01299.png)

Oh boy. 

Weird story. 

## One Last Love Song
The saga of dead girls past. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-13-0c9d86.png)

Oy. 

## Telling Tales

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-13-666257.png)

“True story”

Uh huh. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-13-ca3ef6.png)

Exactly. 

Hilarious (in a twisted sort of way). 

## Shoot

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-13-458fa0.png)

Creepy. Incomplete. 

## Ashes & Honey
### Part One

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-13-5455ee.png)

Supposed to be impossible… so what’s the cost now?

### Part Two

Ah. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-13-ef28f4.png)

An interesting, quiet sort of magic. I like it. 

## Tell Me

An odd ghost story.

## All Those Little Girls and Boys

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-13-9dfc1e.png)

I feel like we’ve already done this, this volume even.
