Fortune telling, Constantine’s father, more evil demons and arguably worse angels, and of course dead soldiers who can’t find rest. 

Not a standout volume, but still pretty good. 

Mini reviews (spoilers):

## The Nature of the Beast 
![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-10-9036fb.png)

Sure…

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-10-25d50c.png)

Reading the future is a common enough trope in this genre, but I enjoyed it. 

## Walking the Dog
Another ghost story...

…ish. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-10-a3188e.png)

Oops. A neat twist. 

## Punkin’ Up the Great Outdoors

Going to be a weird one:

Excellent. 

Of course it all goes poorly in the end. As these sorts of things do. 

## Sins of the Father

That’s an interesting way to do magic, it literally true. I may have to steal it. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-10-94a936.png)

Oh my. 

He’s such an odd / interesting one. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-10-ccd278.png)

As far as strategies/metaphors go…

Quite a hard hitting story. A bit of mental relief for Constantine, I think? And always wondering just how real it was. 

## Football: It’s a Funny Old Game
Constantine, going to a football game. What could possibly go wrong?

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-10-64e4ca.png)

Well…

## Difficult Beginnings
### Part One: The Single Sided Coin

Constantine has been through quite a lot… and the mental toll of that seems to be catching up with him.

### Part Two: The Trouble with Worms

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-10-865252.png)

Oooy. 

### Part Three: The Darkening of the Light

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-10-4fcce0.png)

Now that’s a follow up. Nothing without a cost, especially in Constantine’s world. 

Ellie as well. Oh Constantine(s) you sod(s). 

A weird/incomplete place to end. 

## A Taste of Heaven
In a world where divine inspiration seems both commonplace…

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-10-8a8215.png)

…and to come with a cost? I’m looking forward to it. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-10-f90dbe.png)

Oh Angels. 

## In the Line of Fire
### Part One

A solider’y ghost story sounds like.

### Part Two: Over My Dead Body

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-10-05876a.png)

Another fascinating character. Ripe for puns:

A quick end but a good story.
