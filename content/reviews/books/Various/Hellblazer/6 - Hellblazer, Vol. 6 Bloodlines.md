A very solid issue. A couple of great longer storylines with long term consequences (Guys & Dolls was great) and a few shorter one offs (Lord of the Dance in particular I enjoyed). Could have been longer, but there’s still potentially more story to be told there. 

I'm enjoying seeing Constantine and Kit's relationship evolve. It gives a nice human element to contrast the horror. I only hope that doesn't go too badly for her in the long run...

## The Pub Where I Was Born

I love the feel of the place. A lot of potential. And a bit of a breather after Deadly Habits:

Alas, it wasn’t to last. Not like that’s surprising. It wouldn’t be much of a story otherwise. 

## Love Kills
Well that’s brutal. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-6-1f0c6f.png)

Should have been expected though. 

## Lord of the Dance

(The version I know best.)

Oh. 

Certainly a standalone, but I enjoyed it. 

## Remarkable Lives
You know… I don’t really envy Constantine sometimes.

Who now?

Well that’s a twist. Always interesting to see things that old. Let’s see how Constantine handles this. 

Another solid single. Did Constantine just make a new, very powerful enemy? 

## Counting to Ten
One of those ‘I’ll be there **no matter what** stories, this time with old ladies. Haven’t seen that particular group in this story. A little creepier somehow. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-6-26e036.png)

Because you know it’s going to go all twisty or we wouldn’t be reading it. 

Doesn’t really go anywhere though…

## Royal Blood

Well that's certainly dark... a nice longer storyline. 

### The Players

And when even that goes wrong, who’re you going to call? **Ghostbusters**. Nah. Not nearly snarky enough. 

### Revelations
Part two: the setup…

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-6-6bd47e.png)

… and the politics. 

Ramps up to a wonderfully gross seance and a name:

### The Good Old Days

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-6-42b363.png)

Neat world building. 

### Dog Eat Dog

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-6-b6a471.png)

… ah. So that’s the plan. I suppose it makes a twisted sort of sense. 

And so it is. A good storyline. 

## This is the Diary of Danny Drake
Well that’s a bit of a tonal jump after a four issue story line. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-6-f8db37.png)

Still interesting though. Can’t think of another story I’ve read with a captured Archangel, even hinted at. 

Not hugely much of a story otherwise. 

## Human Clay
Chas’ uncle? Oy. They certainly do seem to fall into a lot of stories. Comes from being protagonists I suppose. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-6-570952.png)

A lot of potential in mixing science and dark magic. I hope that’s where this story is going. Need to find more of that. 

## Body and Soul

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-6-4258fd.png)

There it is. Now all that’s left is how much is intentional… and how do they stop it. 

## Guys & Dolls

Oh I do love this storyline. I hope to see more of it (and given the last issue of this volume, we might just). 

### Fallen Woman

Fascinating. Following up from Sandman #4: {{<crosslink "Season of Mists">}}. Perhaps there *is* something to be said for shared universes.

### Nativity Infernal

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-6-1a9e3d.png)

I love it. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-6-01f144.png)

Sprog!

Crazy story…

## She’s Buying a Stairway to Heaven

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-6-c82bd5.png)

Makes you wonder what’s impossible and what’s just too crazy for most to try…

Really, it’s setting up some future payoff, but oh what the story…
