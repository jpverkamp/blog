An interesting collection. Constantine in India, looking for purity. Punk and the Conservatives. Nergal and Bast’s … cousin, maybe? And Papa Midnite backstory. A lot of leaning on the past, but neat stories.

## India

At least he has some help!

## No Future

The spirit of punk? Sure!

Politics.

## Pandemonium

Haven’t we been down this road before? Bast? Been a while…

That’s… an option.

Close?

Ah. There we are.

Such a bargain!

They’re not entirely wrong. Bit late to figure that out now though. 

## Papa Midnite 

Another face we haven’t seen in a long time…

Ah. I thought I remembered something like that.
