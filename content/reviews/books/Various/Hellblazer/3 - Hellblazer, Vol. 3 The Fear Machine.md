Not terrible, but also not great. It starts very slowly with a hippie commune and takes a few issues to get going and gets downright weird at a few points. But enjoyable enough after that.

Onward!

Issue specific reviews, spoilers:

## Touching the Earth

Oh boy.

And then it goes all weird hippy commune. Sure? I don’t really get it. Imagine paying for this as a single issue…

## Shepherd’s Warning

Well, it’s more of the same story, but there’s potential at least!

An interesting aside I suppose.

## Rough Justice

Incoming authority! And they’re not even here for Constantine! We’re getting hints of weird/spooky though, and best of all:

He’s back!

## “Fellow Travelers”

There we go. That’s the creepy I was looking for.

Still not quite to answers, but questions aplenty.

## Hate Mail & Love Letters

I like the format. Letters / journal entries between the main characters for the most part. An interesting variation.

## The Broken Man

Now we’re getting somewhere.

## Betrayal

Help…

From the most interesting directions. Right up until the end.

## The God of all Gods

Well. So far as twisted evil plans go, that’s certainly one of them.

## Balance

And that’s why it’s rated for mature audiences.

Yay Zed though!
