Another solid volume. In particular, there's another volume about angels/demons/and the troubles they get into. It's not quite as good as the one in {{<crosslink "Hellblazer, Vol. 6: Bloodlines">}}, but still enjoyable. An interesting take on *Gabriel*, that's for sure. 


## End of the Line
Family trouble…

… of the magical kind. 

Both ways:

## Forty 
… years old and all alone. Until:

Now that’s a party. Oh my. They even got Swamp Thing. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-7-ff7935.png)

Literally lol. 

## Fear and Loathing 
### For King and Country

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-7-dcde8c.png)

So… that’s one interpretation of Gabriel. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-7-39fab7.png)

That has a lot of potential!

### London Kills Me

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-7-d843d9.png)

Gabriel might just be finding a better way… and someone is not happy about that.

### Down to Earth

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-7-6bd68c.png)

Oh Gabriel. I have a feeling this is about to go sideways. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-7-922b5c.png)

Oh. Oh oh oh. That’s who that of. And Constantine. Oy. To an Archangel? I mean, the whole ‘pure and good and beautiful’ is arguable given that scene from Part 1… but still. Oh my. 

## Dear John

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-7-7791cf.png)

Oh. Oy. 

## Down All the Days
Constantine isn’t doing so well…

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-7-36b5aa.png)

Also… vampires. Rather a part one. 

## Rough Trade

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-7-ed689c.png)

Ah. There’s the connection. 

Went well enough for Constantine, not that he cares. 

## Tainted Love

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-7-19fb16.png)

The story of Emma… and not. 

## Heartland

Odd and not very Constantine. 

## Finest Hour

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-7-259fde.png)

Still not rock bottom? Or will that of all things be what it takes?

## Confessional 
![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-7-53da4f.png)

Another young Constantine story. Man, he’s had a life. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-7-bb41d7.png)

You know… that’s an interesting argument. 

Probably not what the priest wants to hear though.
