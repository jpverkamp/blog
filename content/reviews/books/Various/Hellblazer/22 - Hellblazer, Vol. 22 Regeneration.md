Some holiday cheer (nothing deep but they’re neat enough), a new girl gone very very wrong, and Chas getting to be the hero. A good volume. 

Individual readalong reviews. Spoilers:

## Christmas Special
### Happy Fucking New Year

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-22-774073.png)

Awfully rude of him not to wait until after New Year’s, what with the thievery and baby sacrifice. 

### Christmas Cards

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-22-34a85d.png)

What’s more Christmas than poker?

### All I Goat For Christmas

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-22-20817b.png)

Constantine done poetically, via the [[wiki:Curse of the Billygoat]](). 

### The Curse of Christmas

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-22-1e0bff.png)

Work/life balance. She’ll take a look at it?

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-22-3827db.png)

Oh. Oh!

Sneaky. 

### Snow Had Fallen 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-22-016684.png)

… well that got dark. And that’s before we get to the industrial magic. 

… snow angels. All righty then. 

## Scab

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-22-6bccfb.png)

I don’t think she believes him. 

She probably should…

That got twisted. Body horror by way of terrible scabs (both the physical and labor Union related kind), memories of an abortion brought to life, and confession by being beaten. Good times. 

## Plague Doctor

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-22-179b50.png)

They’re perfect for each other. 

And then we get ghosts to prevent the Olympics, a plague doctor with a thing for young girls, and a father willing to go way too far for his family. 

## There’s Something About Phoebe

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-22-459e04.png)

… what are you doing Constantine. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-22-714ef8.png)

And she **knows**?!

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-22-b20bbc.png)

Oh, she’s good. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-22-71b20d.png)

Well that sucks. I liked her. 

Although with Constantine, who knows. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-22-9893a9.png)

That didn’t take long. 

## The Cottage

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-22-a62b1a.png)

Oh Constantine. That’s more like you. How many more times is he going to have to try…

## The Long Crap Friday 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-22-266d46.png)

At least he’s making some progress?

## The Knowledge

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-22-c277b8.png)

All those streets to memorize…

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-22-3b11f7.png)

Yo, I heard you like booze. So I put booze in your booze so you can booze while you booze. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-22-c1cc3a.png)

Go Chas!
