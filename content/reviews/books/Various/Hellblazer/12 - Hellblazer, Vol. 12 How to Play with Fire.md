Three multiple parters? No single issues? Sweet. Up the Down Staircase want my favorite, but both How to Play with Fire and Son of Man were excellent. 

Mini reviews, pretty (horrifying) pictures and spoilers: 

## Up the Down Staircase
Memes? I feel like I missed something. Interesting character development, but no real pay off. 

### Part One

You are dating the _wrong_ man. 

Other than that, we have a fairly standard meet the family type scene. Until, Constantine style, it’s not. 

## Part Two

Can’t catch a break, even in the TV. Interesting to try to play a game with an immortal… when you don’t even know the rules. 

### Part Three

I remember that!

### Part Four 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-12-c90b5a.png)

Come to think of it. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-12-c932b3.png)

There’s apparently stories of this having really happened! From a [1904 source](https://archive.org/details/previctoriandram00hughiala/page/12/mode/2up). 


## How to Play with Fire
Now that’s Constantine. Everything coming back to haunt him and him more or less making it our in one piece. 

### Part One: Blowing on the Embers

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-12-e3caa8.png)

A good start. :smile:

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-12-7cadf3.png)

“Observers.” 

She’s not wrong though. 

### Part Two: Fanning the Flames

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-12-ad353a.png)

Of course. 

And that’s not even it… family troubles, (dead) daddy issues, demon issues, relationship troubles. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-12-f7d696.png)

Oy. 

### Part Three: Burning Down the House

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-12-f25bad.png)

Such twisty allegiances. I love it. 

### Part Four: Sifting Through the Ashes 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-12-974409.png)

Oh Constantine. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-12-d37c02.png)

I’d be more concerned if he hasn’t done that before. More than once. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-12-bb3c07.png)

Lol. That is all. 

## Son of Man
Well that was twisted. A great build up, an exploration of Constantine and Chas, and an especially gross and straight up evil baddie. Unfortunately someone of a weak ending. 

### Part One
The art changes can be really strange at times. Their relationship though:

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-12-f0ee8d.png)

Worth. 

### Part Two

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-12-d34560.png)

Ah. Interesting how that often seems to be the one impossible thing. 

As an aside:

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-12-5e6ab7.png)

That’s a fascinating concept. Build a whole book on that. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-12-cfe36d.png)

Or that. 

All leading up to what _Constantine actually did_. Oy. 

### Part Three

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-12-fc7533.png)

Oy. 

### B Part Four 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-12-a6f75b.png)

Ironic, considering. He totally deserved the shiner though. 

### Part Five

Such an insanely twisted villain. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-12-64de05.png)

With such a plan. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-12-de52ee.png)

Oy.
