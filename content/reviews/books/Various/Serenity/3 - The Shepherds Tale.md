Huh. So just last book, I was lamenting the lack of a backstory for Book, and here we are. It's a series of short stories, working backwards from his death (in Serenity). Finally, we get some answers.  

There's not actually anything terribly surprising. We all knew he'd done bad things and turned to religion, but it was still fascinating to read back through the stories and in a backwards sort of way seeing how Sheppard Book came to be.

A wonderful story.  

Not to mention, you get scenes like this:

It goes on for a few pages and is so much _better_ even than that. Hard to imagine; I know. Read it and find out!
