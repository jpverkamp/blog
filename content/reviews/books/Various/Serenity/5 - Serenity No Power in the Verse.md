And so it ends. As far as I can tell, this story takes place after Firely, Serenity, and any of the other graphic novels. We have everyone settling down into a new routing, Emma growing up, Inara in retirement (all down to Earth...). The main plotline follows the additional River-likes we saw last time around, but there are a few new twists. Enough that I could very well have seen a few episodes or a season of Firefly built around it. If only.  

On top of that, we have hints at a more interesting past for Inara (we'd had this before, but never answers):

It was a bit disjointed and felt a bit rushed, but it's still an enjoyable story.  

And to top everything else off, a bedtime story told by River to Emma. It's ... the most beautiful, River thing I've ever seen:

Oh, that is a wonderful way to send off a series. I don't know if there will ever be more Firefly/Serenity comics, but I'm still glad to have read them.
