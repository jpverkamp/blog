Nope, not even a joke. Instead, it’s the heart of one of the best examples of cozy fantasy I’ve read yet.

In a nutshell, there’s not terribly much action. The stakes aren’t world shattering. For the most part, they aren’t even life and death. But the problems are real and the characters are deeply human (even when not a one of them actually is, but you get the idea I hope). It’s all, in a word, cozy. 

I’ve found over the last year or two that I really like this kind of fiction. If you do as well or even if it sounds at all intriguing… go read Legends and Lattes.
