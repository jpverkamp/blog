I just finished reading {{< goodreads book="The Boxcar Children" >}} (the first 19) to my children, so now it's off to Narnia with {{< goodreads book="The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" text="The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" >}} (in publication order). Oh man, we're in for a ride.

Perhaps one of the best known [portal fantasies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy#By_the_function_of_the_fantastic_in_the_narrative), {{< goodreads book="The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" text="The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" >}} is the story of four children sent to live in the Professor's mysterious old house wherein they find a portal (through the aforementioned Wardrobe) into the fantastical land of Narnia, a land full of talking animals and mythological beings of all kinds, ruled by an evil White Witch.  

It's a rather straight forward good versus evil story with little in the way of surprises, but plenty of surprisingly dark scenes that I didn't particularly remember. My oldest seems to be greatly enjoying them, and no nightmares so far, but there is certainly room for discussion after each chapter.

It's got an interesting style, where the author talks, from time to time, directly to the reader, which only helps the fantastic feel. And the world really does feel magical. At first, it's a lighthearted beautiful sort of magic, but that quickly turns darker and more complicated--after all, it's a land that's "always winter, but never Christmas."  

The Jesus-turned-lion allegory in Aslan is a bit on the head and deus ex machina (and for such a larger than life sort of character, there's really not much to him), but there is still room for the children to learn and grow and save the day, so as long as you know what you're in for, it's worth the read.
