That’s cute. I’ve never read it before.  

It’s vaguely reminiscent of The Little House books, but without all the depressing doom and gloom of rebuilding over and over.

The viewpoint mostly centering around a little girl who is almost fine now is particularly cute and seeing her interactions with her older siblings makes me look forward to when my own get to that age.
