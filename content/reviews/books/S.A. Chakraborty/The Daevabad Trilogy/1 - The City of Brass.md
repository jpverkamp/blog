---
18th Century Cairo. Street living, mixed with all manner of quasi magical cons (palm readings, faking healings). And then ... one accidental summoning later and you're off swept into the magical world of childhood stories. 

The world building is really interesting. You get a touch of the Arabic world mixed with a straight up Arabic inspired fantasy world full of djinn in all manner of shapes and sizes... even at the end of the story, I'm not actually 100% sure what all the differences are.

Characterwise, I'm not sure I ever quite got around to liking Nahri. I was rooting for her before she took off, but I'm not thrilled where she ended up. 

> “You're some kind of thief, then?"  
> "That a very narrow-minded way of looking at it. I prefer to think of myself as a merchant of delicate tasks.” 


Ali and Dara though, I quite like the both of them--surprisingly for roughly the same reasons. They are trying to do the 'right thing', just with rather opposing ways of going about that.

> “To keep walking a path between loyalty to your family and loyalty to what you know is right. One of these days, you’re going to have to make a choice.” 

Overall, I'm looking forward to the second book. Onward!
