> Because a lost little girl from Cairo thought she was living in some sort of fairy tale. And because for all her supposed cleverness, she couldn’t see that the dashing hero who saved her was its monster.

If [[The City of Brass]]() set us off on an adventure; The Kingdom of Copper vastly expands the world--and the stakes. 

The city of *Daevabad* is a mess. Nahri's life is a mess. Ali's exile is a mess. Dara is dead--but what else is new?--and also a mess. 

This is a book about war and violence and family squabbles writ kingdom large. We're truly in the magical world now, and oh there's far more depths to that world that we knew. 

Of all the middle books of a trilogy out there, few do quite so well as this one. It's still got some middle book issues--it doesn't *really* stand alone--but for what it is, I'm quite impressed. 

I'm so looking forward to finishing this one. I fully expect even more and worse messes before (if) everything is wrapped up. 

Onward!

> “No, I wasn't afraid. I was tired." Ali's voice broke on the word. "I'm tired of everyone in this city feeding on vengeance. I'm tired of teaching our children to hate and fear other children because their parents are our enemies. And I'm sick and tired of acting like the only way to save our people is to cut down all who might oppose us, as if our enemies won't return the favor the instant power shifts.
