I enjoy fables. It's a nice way to illustrate various lessons and morals and pass them along to children somewhat subtly. Especially when you take the wordcraft and illustrations of {{< goodreads author="Arnold Lobel" >}} ({{< goodreads book="Frog and Toad Storybook Treasury: 4 Complete Stories in 1 Volume!" text="Frog and Toad" >}}).

The children enjoyed the stories. Some of them, they understood and laughed at. Some went right over their heads. Some honestly didn't make that much sense even to me. I don't even agree with all of the morals, but that gives you a chance to talk about it afterwords, which is worthwhile. Plus, they're fun little stories and each individual one is a quick, self-contained read.

I hope to be worthy.
