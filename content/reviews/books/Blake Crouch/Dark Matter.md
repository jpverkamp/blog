I went into {{< goodreads book="Dark Matter" text=" Dark Matter " >}} not actually knowing much about the book. So the first couple of chapters (where the main character is kidnapped by mysterious figures, has his whole life turned upside down, and then apparently meets his wife for the first time) was... intense.

And it never really lets go. The action keeps going and the mystery/science keeps getting weirder.

I think my favorite part is  {{< spoiler >}}once Jason returns home{{< /spoiler >}}  and you realize there are still a fair few chapters left, more than would probably be needed to deal with  {{< spoiler >}}Jason2{{< /spoiler >}}  . I've read/seen a fair few multiple reality type books, it's not an uncommon trope, but I don't recall another one that deals with the idea of splitting off new realities in real time, **after** precipitating events of the book. That's pretty cool.  

In any case, that's quite a book. Well worth the read. I have a couple other Blake Crouch books on my ever expanding too-read shelf. I'll have to bump those up...
