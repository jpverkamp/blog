{{< goodreads book="Lady Friday" cover="true" >}}

It's interesting throughout the whole series, Nix has managed to combine a relatively formulaic story with new twists and weird new worlds in each and every book.  

The House just keeps getting weirder. I'm not sure how it's even really a 'House' at all. I think originally it was going to be and the Tuesday and Wednesday happened...

We don't actually see much of Lady Friday; the least of any thus far. So it goes.  

It's interesting to see Arthur finally accept that he's going to finish this and, to do that, he has to use the Keys. Given how narrow a margin he was on before, I was curious how long that would take.  

The Will is going to be a problem...  

Five down, two to go.
