Overall, everything I was hoping for in an ending to the series.  

We get to see a lot of Sunday and Sunday's realm: the Incomparable Gardens. It makes as much sense as anything in the rest of the House, so just go with it.

There's a lot of action, more than any previous book.  

It's nice to see a bit more development in Leaf and Suzy.  

The ending was... weird. Given the rest of the series, perhaps I shouldn't be surprised.
