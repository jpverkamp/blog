Who would have thought that a colour could be so terrifying...  

I guess it helps that it's actually some life devouring, madness inducing shade that fell to earth in a meteorite and proceeded to wreck havoc on a local farm.

It's a quick, solid story, telling about how everyone was so intrigued by the meteorite--until the family nearest it fell apart.  

Worth the read.
