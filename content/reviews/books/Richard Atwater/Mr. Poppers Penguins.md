Well that's a delightful if a bit bizarre little book.  

In a nutshell, Mr. Popper is an orderinary enough man who happens to absolutely love stories about Arctic/Antarctic expeditions. He writes a letter to Admiral Drake and... gets a penguin shipped to him. One thing leads to another, he gets another penguin, they have an unusually large pile of chicks, and they go on the road.  

<!--more-->

There are all manner of things that through a more modern eye are questionable at best, animal cruelty at worst, but if you take it how it's written it's a fun little romp and the children enjoyed it immensely.  

Now the next question is--just how inappropriate is the Jim Carrey version for children...?
