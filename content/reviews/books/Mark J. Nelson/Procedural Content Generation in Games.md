It's been a while since I've read a textbook. :) This is exactly the sort I would have lost myself in during undergrad (and to some extent did even now).  

On one level, there is a lot more summary and general content that I could probably have done without. But on the other, the few concrete examples were intriguing and even the summary sections gave me other papers and terms to search for and read more.

If you're into procedural content, it's worth a read (for games or not). You can buy a copy or (up until a few days ago), you could read it online. The domain seems to have recently expired though... so that's a bummer.
