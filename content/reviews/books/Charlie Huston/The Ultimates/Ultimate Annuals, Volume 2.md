title: Ultimate Annuals, Volume 2

Fantastic Four is a duplicate and the Ultimates (focussed on Captain America) was weird, but I really enjoyed the X-Men and Spider-Man issues.

Individual reviews (very minor spoilers):

## Ultimates

The fallout of Grand Theft America. Captain America not dealing well with his time shift—as we knew. 

And of course…

… the ghost the the machine?

It feels less earned without any Captain America backstory in this universe. 

## Fantastic Four 
Once again, already in Inhuman. It didn’t make much sense there and wasn’t that much more interesting—especially without any follow through. 

## X-Men
Dazzler is awake! And Nightcrawler is perhaps not taking this well.

The only Nightcrawler I know is from the movies, so I don’t like this at all. Curious if we’ll get more of this story. 

## Spider-Man
Been a while since we saw Spider-Man and his cop friend.

Did we know that?!

Daredevil and the Punisher showing up was fun though!

And Moon Knight!

That’s the problem with these two concurrent Marvel universes… I want to read more about all these characters but none of them have their own issues in the Ultimate universe. Such is life.
