Well that's a surprisingly wonderful story. It's something of a mix of It's a Wonderful Life and Borges' The Library of Babel. Nora Seed finds herself in a dark place, between life and death--and that place just happens to look to her like a library. A library with a book for every life she could have lived, every choice she could have made.

It's not a new story at its core, but it's very well done. I find it interesting how we throughout the book, you start knowing nothing about how the 'library' works, then as you go on, you learn more and more, until suddenly at the end--you know nothing at all again. Was it all a dream? How did it work?  

It's a wonderful story. I enjoyed the various lives and how they all interacted. I found the Seeds (heh) of depression and how it dealt with medication to be interesting and on point. And though I'm the sort that really wants to know *how it all works* in a novel, sometimes it's okay to just go with it.  

Well well worth the read, especially I'd say if you're someone going through a tough time and needing answers. Granted, you probably won't find answers here, but you might just get a better handle on what the questions should perhaps be.
