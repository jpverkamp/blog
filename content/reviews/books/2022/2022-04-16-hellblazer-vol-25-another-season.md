Man Constantine’s life is a mess. Father in law has some use for him—which goes badly. He’s down a thumb and needs to deal with that—which goes badly. His coat’s gone evil walkabout—which goes badly. Gemma has it out for him (or at least his demonic twin)—which goes badly. 

I think you get the idea. 

A solid enough issue, but certainly an odd one.

## High-Frequency Man

Yeah that’s still weird. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-25-75b611.png)

Wonderful. Amusing that marriage seems to have gotten Constantine interested in perhaps making a buck and I’m curious how the Druid is going to come back to mess things up (I assume he’s not the trader?). 

## Phantom Pains

Who’s got two thumbs and some bizarre marital problems? Not Constantine!

B plot!

Maybe not so B plot. Gemma certainly has some baggage…

That was definitely twisted. And there’s not so much time any more, but I expect we’ll see a bit more fallout yet. 

## Inside

Oy. That’s an ask. And an art style…

A weirdly quick and strange story. 

## The Devil’s Trench Coat

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-25-8c02c3.png)

Point of view: coat. All righty then. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-25-2fb7f6.png)

That will certainly go well for him…

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-25-b71385.png)

Fair…

Oh that coat. 

Oh Gemma… and Terry. Ooooooy. 

## Another Season in Hell

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-25-8d586c.png)

That’s a visual. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-25-fce66f.png)

I thought a brother?

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-25-d857ad.png)

Oh that’s a lovely line. 

Man Constantine messes up those around him. At least he finally did some goodish helping his sister leave hell? Ish. M
