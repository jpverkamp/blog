Maus. What's there even to say? It's a story about a son and a father. About growing up Jewish during the rise of the Nazi party and during the Holocaust. About the ways that dramatically changes the lives of even those survive.

All told in a comic book style with different style animals for different races.

It's a fascinating way to tell the story (a (Jewish) mouse wearing a (Polish) pig mask to hide from the Nazis...) even if / perhaps because it raises questions of it's own. And Spiegelman really can tell a story.

It's worth the read.
