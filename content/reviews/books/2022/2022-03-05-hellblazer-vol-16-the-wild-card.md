{{< goodreads book="Hellblazer, Vol. 16: The Wild Card" cover="true" >}}

A crazy bloody mess with some old friends in the longer stories and a few neat bits in the short ones. But more of Angela and Gemma. 

A rather solid volume. 

Thoughts as I read (spoilers):

## High on Life

Constantine with brown hair?! (Might be red) What’s this?

Bit of an ass. 

Using his blood to heal/as a pick me up is quite the trick.

That’s a neat trick…

# Red Sepulchre
Really a continuation on High Life. It literally starts with ‘Six months later’.

Shadowy back room dealings go!

That’s a neat trick!

Map is  back! Sort of.

Ooooh it’s all in the family. That’s going to be complicated.

Now that’s a wonderfully nasty trick. 

A good story. 

# The Game of Cat and Mouse 
The fallout continues.

That’s so Constantine…

# Black Flowers

I have a feeling it’s only beginning…

# Third Worlds
## The Wild Card
Haven’t seen Swamp Thing in a long while!

That’ll be a neat trick. 

## Ordeal

I’ve always enjoyed world building like this. 

## The Pit

She’s fun. And ended up being a lot of help!

# Bred in the Bone

![](/embeds/books/attachments/hellblazer-16-3fa230.png)

A fitting title it seems.

When the things that go bump in the night go bump in the night…

A neat idea. 

A neat story.
