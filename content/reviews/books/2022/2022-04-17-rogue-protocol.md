I do love me some Murderbot. 

First, we got the [origin story]({{<ref "2022-04-08-all-systems-red.md">}}) and then the [one where the mystery deepens]({{<ref "2022-04-15-artificial-condition">}}). Now... Muderbot is really digging into where it came from ... and what int eh world GrayCris is doing there. It's a fun story and I really love seeing Murderbot learn and grow as a person*. It's all about the relationships--Murderbot and all the people, Miki with it's childlike personality that may actually be loved, and of course Dr. Mensah. 

Onwards we go! I kind of love this more novella length / serialized approach.
