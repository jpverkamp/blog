Constantine gets his Mojo back. 

Joyride is a pretty  crazy story which may yet come back to haunt us. All His Engines is even better, getting some Aztec flair in line. A good volume. 

## In The Deep End

Quite a way to execute someone. 

## Wheels of Change, Systems of Control

He’s back? Oh Constantine.

Ooh Constantine. Quite the work of art. 

## Joyride

Magic? Or something more run of the mill—drugs?

A trap he really should have been more careful about.

Imagine living over something like that.

Depends on the small town, really. 

## The Smoke

Such delightful world building.

I do prefer ‘still tries to do the right thing’ Constantine. 

## All His Engines

Friends come in handy sometimes.

Got a point there. 

### Part V: No Second Stroke
