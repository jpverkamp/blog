> If they cannot be woken to a natural affection for their country, such as we feel, it is our fault and not theirs.

Where Laurence is condemned for Treason for trying to prevent war crimes and Temeraire is on his own--and ends up starting a sort of soft revolution among the dragons. 

It's quite a story. 

Laurence having to go against loyalty, against king and country was a Big Thing last book, so seeing the fallout of that goes about as expected. It's dark. And we're still not done with it. 

And seeing Temeraire come into his own, basically take over the breeding grounds, and speak for dragonkind in Britain? Love it. Plus, a whole bunch of Temeraire point of view! Couldn't do it any other way and the voices are as distinct as I expected. But it's lovely to see. 

It's quite a book and well worth the read in the series. 

Onward to see what happens next!

Side note:

> [Maximus] put his head down and said in a conspiratorial whisper, â€œTell Temeraire that Lily and I have not forgotten our promise; we will not let them hang you at all."
> 
> Laurence stared up at the immense Regal Copper. All his crew looked deeply distressed, as well they might, the outlaw remark being perfectly audible several clearings over.


It continues being delightful to read about the largest dragons trying to be sneaky.
