title: Peter Nimble and His Fantastic Eyes
---
> Peter stood back up. 'Well, that was a perfectly useless conversation,' he said with a sigh.
> 
> Now, there is a wonderful thing in this world called 'foresight.' It is a gift treasured above all others because it allows one to know what the future holds. most people with foresight end up wielding immense power in life, often becoming great rulers or librarians.

Well that was a fun--if weirdly surreal at times--little adventure.

In a nutshell, Peter Nimble is quite the example of [blind therefore superpowers](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower). He's a ten year old blind boy, living alone on the streets. So of course he becomes the perfect thief. And when one day he steals a box containing three pairs of magical eyes?

> As you know, children (unlike grown-ups) are far too clever to be tricked by impostors - a fact that goes a long way toward explaining their distrust of wicked stepmothers and substitute teachers.

Well if that isn't recipe for adventure, I don't know what is. 

> I have called you forth not because of what you may become, but because of what you already are.

Once you get out fo the city and into the magical lands, things start getting really weird/fantastical.

We have a kitten/horse/knight (Sir Tode!). The sandy land of Just Deserts. A kingdom of magical mind controlled parents. Ravens. Clockwork armor. Oh so many ravens. 

And oh so much more. 

It reminds me, in that, a lot of Alice and Wonderland and the Wizard of Oz. Which I'd count a good thing. It's a world that almost doesn't make sense, but it's just weird and wonderful enough that you stop caring quite so much about that and just go along for the ride. 

> A boy your age should know better than to consider anything impossible.

Overall, a fun story, especially to read with a child around Peter's age. I don't know if I'll catch the sequel just now, but really, the first stands well enough alone. I'm glad to have read it!
