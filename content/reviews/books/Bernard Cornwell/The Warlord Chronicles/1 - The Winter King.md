> ONCE UPON A TIME, in a land that was called Britain, these things happened.

This is an odd one to review. It's well written, decently paced (although I found it slow in general), and--so far as I know--well researched for the time period. On the other hand, I tend strongly to prefer fantasy and science fiction (which this is not, despite all the hints at the contrary) and a little more action. This book tends to talk a lot more than fight, building up to a few big battles that last mere moments. 

> Magic, she said, happened at the moments when the lives of the Gods and men touched, but such moments were not commanded by men.

So far as an Arthurian story, I have a few bits and pieces in my mind--which this does not match at all. Given that Arthur may have but probably did not actually exist, variations are common, but the idea that it's built into the story--that as time progresses, even the characters talk about how the stories and myths are already growing. Speaking of which, I really do love the point of view--and everyman living in the vicinity of Arthur, Merlin, et al. It's a great way to do it. 

> These are the tales of the land we call Lloegyr, which means the Lost Lands, the country that was once ours but which our enemies now call England. These are the tales of Arthur, the Warlord, the King that Never Was, the Enemy of God and, may the living Christ and Bishop Sansum forgive me, the best man I ever knew. How I have wept for Arthur.

Overall, I'm glad to have read it and if it's a genre you prefer more than me, you'll probably love it. But I won't be continuing with this series / author at the moment. So it goes.
