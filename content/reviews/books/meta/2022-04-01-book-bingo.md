Let's do this again! I [barely made it]({{<ref "2022-03-31-book-bingo-retrospective">}}), but there were so many books that I absolutely ended up loving that I'm not sure I otherwise would have read. So this year, better!

Rules:
- Must be speculative fiction (SF, fantasy, horror with speculative elements)
- Limit the number of novellas (fewer than 40k words or defined by the author as such) or combine them
- A book of short stories counts
- Graphic novels/manga should be treated as novellas
- Web novels count (if they're long enough)
- Audiobooks count

This post will automatically update as I tag books and I'll post ~if~ when I finish! I'm going to go for hard mode again as much as possible. Should be fun. :D
