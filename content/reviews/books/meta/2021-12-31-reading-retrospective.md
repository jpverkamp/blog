Well. That was a year. Covid, take 2. A new job. A new baby. I didn't quite make my 200 books this year (I didn't quite even make it to 1/2 days), but that's okay. I still read a giant pile. :D

Some stats:

* 179 books read: 1 every 2.04 days (almost!)
* 47,236 pages read: roughly 130 pages/day
* 29 audiobooks, 96 graphic novels, 18 children's chapter books, 18 non-fiction
* 56 unique authors (top were Hajime Isayama, Patricia Briggs, Warren Ellis, and Neil Gaiman)
* 19 series (top were Attack on Titan, Mercy Thompson/Alpha & Omega, Sandman, and Runelords)

Shortest: {{< crosslink "The Shepherd's Tale" >}} with 56 pages, longest: {{< crosslink "The Holy Bible: Revised Standard Version, Catholic Edition" >}} with over 1000. That feels like cheating though, so let's go with {{< crosslink "Rhythm of War" >}} at 1270 / {{< crosslink "Crafting Interpreters" >}} at 865. :smile: 

The most read book I read this year was {{< crosslink "1984" >}} with 5 million others reading it (on Goodreads alone; I was working on my earliest backlog). Least popular: {{< crosslink "Tales of Nezura: Book 1: The Zevolra" >}} with only 39. It ... wasn't bad. Give it a try?

Overall, I gave 119 five-star ratings, 45 four-star, 7 three-star, and less than 10 other ratings. I've come to the realization over the last year that I tend to like just about everything. Books in particular, they're only on my list if I think I'd find them interesting, so of course, they'll be rated highly... 

Not bad.

All together, I read:

* Graphic Novels
    * Attack on Titan
    * Serenity
    * The Sandman
    * White Sand

* Children's Chapter Books
    * Chronicles of Narnia
    * The Borrowers

* Novels († audiobooks, ‡ in progress)
    * Alpha & Omega
    * Books of the Ancestor
    * Chief Inspector Armand Gamache (only read 1)
    * Gemma Doyle
    * Lady Astronaut
    * Mercy Thompson †
    * Runelords †‡
    * The Broken Earth †
    * The Infernal Devices
    * The Locked Tomb ‡
    * The Risen Kingdoms
    * The Stormlight Arshive
    * The Warlord Chronicles

There were a lot of good books in there!

I'm still working on my {{< crosslink "2021 Book Bingo" >}}, so that will be my main driver for books starting this year (and I won't be making an overall list), but this year I really do want to hit 200. Let's DO IT!

If you really want to dig into it, here's the full list of this year's posts (in order):

{{< taxonomy-list "reviews/lists" "2021 Book Reviews" >}}

Pretty crazy looking at it that way. :smile:
