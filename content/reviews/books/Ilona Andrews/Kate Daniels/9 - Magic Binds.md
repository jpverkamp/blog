Understand or not, it's still wonderful.  

Drawing towards a conclusion (only one book left) and the witches have some pretty terrible fortellings. Death and babies and the death of babies. Which of course Kate is going to do everything in her power to stop.  

Speaking of power though... Kate's coming into the power that is her birthright and as they say, power corrupts. She's got some dark impulses going on. With the time that's left, I'm not overworried about the rise of the EVIL DARTH KATE... But it's good reading watching her deal with it all.  

I think the best part of the story is the worldbuilding getting deeper and crazier with each book. We finally get to find out just who/what Christopher is (which without knowing him as we do wouldn't be nearly as impactful). We get a callback to an underused character (  {{< spoiler >}}Aunt Erra, now in knife form, but with a force ghost{{< /spoiler >}}  ), and a lot more about Roland's origins. Pretty cool. Also the whole bit with Roman and Gods of nasty things:  

> “It’s not that I’m that evil, really. I’m just beloved by evil things.”

And now only one remaining (barring side stories). I can't wait... and am not sure I'm ready for it to be over.  

Onwards!
