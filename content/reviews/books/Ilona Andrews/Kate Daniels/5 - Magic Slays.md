Kate's no longer a mercenary and needs something to do with her time and skills, so ends up opening a private investigation business. Which of course takes a while to get going, so when she's hired by Ghastek and the People to track down a runaway vampire... things of course are going to go from bad to worse. That's quite a thing.  

It's an interesting twist to see the big bads this time around to be  {{< spoiler >}}more or less vanilla humans that hate magic{{< /spoiler >}}  . It's been done before, but that doesn't make it any less worth exploring in a world where magic (sometimes) reigns supreme.

I think that one of my favorite things about this series remains the relationships. Kate and Curran are a wonderful couple in all the weirdness they get up to, but the stand out this time around is really Kate and Andrea. It's solid to see a friendship between two kick ass women (together they can kill things with swords **and** guns!).  

Also Curran.

He's nuts. But he really does love Kate. And no matter how much he hates it, he loves her enough to be her own person and get into and out of her own trouble. Go Kate and Curran!
