> “Fortune favors the brave," I told her. It also kills the stupid, but I decided to keep that fact to myself.

Curran is out of town, so of course things are going to go wrong. Taking a lot of what's been building, between the Pack having troubles with a non-shifter as essentially second in command, the relationship between the Pack and the People, Kate's trouble with Roland and more particularly with Hugh.

Things take a while to really get rolling and it doesn't completely feel like the halves of the story entirely gel together. But in the end, it's still a pretty solid story. Not the best of the series but pretty good and with the first **real** onscreen appearance of  {{< spoiler >}}Roland{{< /spoiler >}}  . Things are going to get real. So many expectations... and he ends up even more chilling and human than expected.  

And oh man.  {{< spoiler >}}Slayer{{< /spoiler >}}  gets replaced?! For a non-character character, it's impressive how much I actually felt that.  

And then that ending...  {{< spoiler >}}Curran is going to give up everything he's built for Kate... (although to be fair, I bet he won't mind a little less pressure for a while) That's something.{{< /spoiler >}}

“It’s not funny.”  

“It’s hilarious.” The smile slid off Andrea’s face and she vomited on the snow.  

“Karma,” I told her.   (hide spoiler)  ]
