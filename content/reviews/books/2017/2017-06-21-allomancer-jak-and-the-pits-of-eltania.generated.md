Allomancer Jak is a hilarious, pulpy, over the top adventure story set on the Mistborn universe (specifically the Alloy of Law time period).  

It adds a bit of world building--specifically explaining how the Koloss have changed since the first era of the Final Empire--but mostly it's just fun to read.

I'm especially amused by the numerous footnotes 'written' by the editor. It's a bit annoying to jump back and forth on the Kindle, but worth it.
