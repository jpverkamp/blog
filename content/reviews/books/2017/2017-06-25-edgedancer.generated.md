{{< goodreads book="Edgedancer" cover="true" >}}

Edgedancer is a short story set in Sanderson's Cosmere, specifically on Roshar of the Stormlight Archive. It features Lift, a young girl who was first featured in one of the interludes of {{< goodreads book="Words of Radiance" >}} interludes and now has a story all to her own.  

In short, Lift is a lot of fun. She's a surgebinder who can make herself 'awesome'--her term for it--and basically ignore friction. She seems an overall good person with a somewhat odd sense of morals and has a way of talking and acting that will just leave you smiling.

Storywise, we learn a bit more about the world of the Stormlight Archive and actually get some backstory on Darkness--who we saw in Words of Radiance changing character fairly dramatically. And now we know why.  

Overall, well worth the read. Especially if you've already read the Stormlight Archives.
