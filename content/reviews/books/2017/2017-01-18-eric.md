{{< goodreads book="Eric" cover="true" >}}

Eric is an amusing enough story and an interesting continuation of Rincewind's story, after the events back in Sourcery. Not entirely long story slightly shorter, Rincewind gets accidently summoned by a budding 14 year old summoner. Unfortunately for all involved, this seems to actually grant him some demonic powers... and hijinks ensue.  

The basic plot leaves something to be desired. Basically Eric makes three wishes and things go badly about as one might expect. It's even more random feeling than many of the previous Rincewind novels, which is saying something. Characterwise, Eric just isn't particularly interesting, so we're just left with Rincewind. As amusing as he is, he's not quite enough to carry an entire novel all by himself. Previously, we had Twoflower or Cohen... Not so much this time.

On the other hand, you still get Pratchett's trademark pile of quips and randomness. The worldbuilding is still amusing. So it's worth reading just for that + the completeness. I'm expecting they'll continue to get better though.  

Favorite line?  

> “No enemies had ever taken Ankh-Morpork. Well technically they had, quite often; they city welcomed free-spending barbarian invaders, but somehow the puzzled raiders found, after a few days, that they didn’t own their horses any more, and within a couple of months they were just another minority group with its own graffiti and food shops.”
