Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell is a fascinating Sanderson story set in an out of the way corner of his shared universe--the cosmere.  

It's a creepy short (for Sanderson) that follows an older woman (probably middle aged). She's a mother, an inn-keeper, and a bounty hunter. She's a wonderful character and really does do a lot to sell the story.

> I believe in the God Beyond,” Silence said, after they reached the other side.

> “But—”

> “I don’t worship,” Silence said, “but that doesn’t mean I don’t believe. The old books, they called this land the home of the damned. I doubt that worshiping does any good if you’re already damned. That’s all.”

I'd love to see a bit more in this universe, but that goes for just about anything Sanderson writes in the cosmere.  

Whether you are looking to read everything you can in the cosmere or if you just want a dark fantasy short, this book is worth the read.
