The Last Hero is a quick read, much shorter than some of the other Discworld books. It does manage to say relatively self contained though, which is nice.  

Basically Cohen the Barbarian and his Silver Horde have conquered the world. Next up? The gods. Unfortunately that will apparently have negative consequences, so Rincewind and friends have to stop them. Once again Rincewind goes over the edge, this time in a ~~rocket~~ DRAGON powered spaceship. That's certainly a thing.

It's funny. I like seeing Cohen back.  

There's just not much to it.  

One downside of listening to this one in audiobook is apparently missing out on some pretty crazy illustrations.

So it goes.
