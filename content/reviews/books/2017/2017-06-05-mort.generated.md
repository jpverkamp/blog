> Tʜᴇʀᴇ's ɴᴏ ᴊᴜsᴛɪᴄᴇ, ᴛʜᴇʀᴇ's ᴊᴜsᴛ ᴍᴇ. —Death

Another day, another subseries of Discworld. This time: **DEATH**. We've seen him in a few other series, but this is the first point we really get to look at the skeletal anthropomorphization itself.  

<!--more-->

Basically, Mort is an awkward young man looking for a job. He gets hired on by **DEATH** and wacky hijinks ensue. He messes up a few reapings, purposely doesn't do another, and the entire universe is about to collapse.  

It's definitely among my favorites of the Discworld books thus far, well worth the listen. I'm looking forwards to see where else this subseries can go.
