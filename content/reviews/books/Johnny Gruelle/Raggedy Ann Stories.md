title: Raggedy Ann Stories
---
Well those are wonderful. It's Toy Story nearly a century before Toy Story (I wonder just how old 'toys come alive' stories are?), with a doll and her friends waking up and getting into all sorts of delightfully weird and cute trouble.

Story by story.

## Raggedy Ann Learns a Lesson

And so it’s Toy Story! Or perhaps Toy Story is Raggedy Ann? 

In any case… where does the food dolls eat go? And how exactly did Marcella think they got into the jam?

(I expect the answer is “they went to get it themselves” and she’s an age where that’s just fine!)

## Raggedy Ann and the Kite

Well I'm sure that was quite the experience. To be lifted into the air by a kite! 

And then... did Raggedy Ann talk to the birds? Does that count?! What are the rules!?!

## Raggedy Ann Rescues Fido

Adventure! A rescue mission!

And of course dogs can speak. But apparently not to people--only to each other and dolls. 

Weird world. 

Cute stories. 

## Raggedy Ann and the Strange Dolls

New fancy dolls! It's Buzz Lightyear all over long ago!

Except it all goes far better and more simply. And then (so far) the new dolls were never mentioned again. 

## Raggedy Ann and the Kittens

Kittens in the barn! Mama is hiding them away and guarding against Fido--even when he's trying to help! So it's up to Raggedy and the dolls to save the day. 

## Raggedy Ann and the Chickens

Cluck cluck. Raggedy falls right into the chickens! And Mr. Rooster attacks! My youngest was actually a little scared at this one, but it ended up cute! I fully expected some imprinting but oh that would have been complicated! 

Amusing how similar this and Kittens both end. 

## Raggedy Ann's New Sister

Half a story of another doll lost at the beach--and saved by fairies, apparently--and half Raggedy Ann taken apart so they could make hundreds of copies of her. 

... that's creepy right?

And so it ends.
