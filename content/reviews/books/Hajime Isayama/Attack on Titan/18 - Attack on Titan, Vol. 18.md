Man things just keep getting crazier and more cliffhangery. (It's totally a word).

We get more hints at a broader world and Eren's father, who really seems to be quite in the thick of it, as if we didn't know that.

One fun (in a manner of speaking) bit of worldbuilding was how the characters react to meat. It's hard but ignorable enough the costs of eating meat in our world, but in one with such a limited supply of land (and where you might very well end up *as* the meat). Well...
