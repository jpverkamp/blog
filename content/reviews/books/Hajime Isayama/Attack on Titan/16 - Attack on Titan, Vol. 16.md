Man it just keeps getting crazier and crazier. On one hand, we have more and more human on human violence in a giant underground columns set piece, perfect for their vertical maneuvering equipment.

It's pretty crazy and spectacular.  

On the other, a bit more backstory/worldbuilding concerning the Reiss family, Eren, and the Titan powers.  

Oy.  

A crazy story that I have no idea where it's going to end up.

And of course... why you have to kill Titans by slicing the neck. It all comes down to spines and spinal fluid for some reason.

Oy.
