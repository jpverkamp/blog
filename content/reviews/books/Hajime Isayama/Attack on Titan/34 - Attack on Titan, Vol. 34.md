Isn't available in a combined volume in English yet, but I can still read the individual chapters. Will have to pick it out when it comes up.  

Until then...

Man that's a ridiculous conclusion. Some absolutely spectacular battle scenes with all of the named titans over and over again. We knew it was going to happen--and I really want to watch the anime now. It's hard to really imagine any of this.

Yet to imagine... Eren had a plan all along. There are certain advantages to being able to see the future I suppose.

Side note: ... where'd the giant bird come from? Did I miss that?  

Imagine all of the wall titans just sort of hanging out there after they shut down. Quite the reminder.
