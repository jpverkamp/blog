Oh this extended world. The idea that there is a race of people (the Eldians) with a special power unique to their people which makes them makes them hated and feared, relegated to a suppressed class. Except a minor few that are brain washed and weaponized. It's a story we've heard time and time again, even going back throughout history, but that doesn't mean it's a bad story. It's one that really needs to be told.

And oy is it told.  

Spoilers:  

Well. I guess I sort of saw that coming. Interesting that there's such a time skip though.
