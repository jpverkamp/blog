It’s straight up Spider-Man, 400 years ago. Octavius, Lizard, Goblin, Fisk. All the villains you’d expect in about to the ways you’d expect them. 

It’s enjoyable, but not exactly groundbreaking. 

My one (strong dislike) is replacing Virginia Dare with Mary Jane Watsonne. So not necessary… a problem with comics.

Subtle.

Hanks Pym and McCoy helping out a more naturalistic Octavius. Mix and match. Love it.

They even have to fit in the black suit somehow.
