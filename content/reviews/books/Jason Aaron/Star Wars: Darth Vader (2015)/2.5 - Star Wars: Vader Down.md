And now things get complicated… Vader Down is a crossover between [[Star Wars (2015)]](), [[Star Wars: Darth Vader (2015)]]() and a single standalone issue. It’s a neat story, but out so I wish there were easier to read on Marvel Unlimited…

Turns out Anakin can still fly…

Anyways, Vader is forced down. One thing leads to another and the Rebellion decides that an entire battalion might be needed to keep him down. 

This may not be enough. 

It’s nice to see Dr. Aphra again. Been a a bit. And oh the droids. 

For as annoying as it is to switch from series to series, that’s quite an enjoyable story.
