STAR WARS #33-37 
Annual #3

So many different stories in this one! 

We have the beach episode.

A Lando Calrissian and Sana Starros team up…

…double (triple? Quadruple?!) cross!

Han (with a weirdly photorealistic face) and Chewie transporting a Hutt:

And R2-D2 on a mission!

I’d … forgotten that C-3PO had gotten captured. 

And if that wasn’t enough, Scar Squadron—and our favorite Storm Trooper with a lightsaber.

That’s still weird to type. 

I do enjoy the idea of a Storm Trooper just trying to do the right thing—that doesn’t actually join or even *support* the Rebellion. It’s a neat story we haven’t gotten in the movies/TV (that I’ve seen). 

It’s quite the mix and feels a bit disjoined, but I enjoyed it all well enough. I just was hoping for a bit more closure.
