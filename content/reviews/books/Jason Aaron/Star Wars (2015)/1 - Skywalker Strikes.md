Let's read another [[Marvel Star Wars]]() series! This time, getting a bit away from Vadar, we have Star Wars (2015). Set (initially) right after A New Hope, we have the fallout of the (first) Death Star and the whole gang out on a variety of adventures!

Overall, it's a fun start. I'm looking forward to seeing where they go from here!

(minor spoilers)

It's fun to see them all:

Along with snarky droids:

And potshots at the Falcon:

It's quite the adventure:

And that's all in the first issue. 

I expect this should be a fun romp. Especially the early dynamic between Han Solo and Princess Leia:

Especially especially when a certain someone (that never really came up in the movies) shows up:

Oh my. 

Onward!
