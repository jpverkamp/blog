C-3PO has been captured!

And Iâ€™m not sure whoâ€™s the worse off for it. ðŸ˜„ 

Itâ€™s not *entirely* clear if Darth Vader recognizes him or not. With as many memory wipes as C-3PO has apparently gone through, itâ€™s worth wondering if heâ€™s still even the same as he was when Anakin first built himâ€¦ 

But really, in an interesting sort of flip, most of this volume is the backstory! Andâ€”as might be hinted at by the titleâ€”we actually get pre-Prequel era Yoda! And Qui-Gon Jinn. Now I want to read more Qui-Gon Jinn stories. I wonder if thatâ€™s a thing. 

Anyways, Yoda on a planet of feralâ€”and force sensitive because of courseâ€”children. Because of course thatâ€™s a story that has to be in the Star Wars canon. It actually gets far more interesting that I expected, but as Star Wars (outside of the movies) seems wont to doâ€¦ things get *weird*. 

Itâ€™s a fascinating story, but again falls a bit into â€˜just how much did Luke do outside of the moviesâ€™ trap that just feels weird. 

Onward!
