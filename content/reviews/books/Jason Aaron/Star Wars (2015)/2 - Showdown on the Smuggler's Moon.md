The continuing in between adventures of all our original trilogy friends!

It’s a fun one, a dueling pair of adventures and a bit of backstory bridging the original trilogy and the prequels. I think that’d be an interesting era to read more about. How exactly did things go *so badly* so quickly.

Han and Leia are off meeting old wives (and getting shot at).

Luke is off reading Obi-Wan’s diaries…

…and bumping into Hutts. What else is new?

It’s such a mess that they have to end up rescuing Luke from, but I kind of appreciate that. Each gets their own turn being the one in distress!

(Side note: I thought lightsabers were supposed to be difficult to wield without the force…)
