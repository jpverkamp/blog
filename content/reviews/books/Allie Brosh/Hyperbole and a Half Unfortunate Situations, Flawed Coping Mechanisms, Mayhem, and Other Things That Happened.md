400 pages? Pick it up around midnight? Sure! Let's just read it straight though!  

{{< goodreads book="Hyperbole and a Half: Unfortunate Situations, Flawed Coping Mechanisms, Mayhem, and Other Things That Happened" >}} is based on the [blog of the same name](https://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/) and appears to be essentially a printing of a number of stories that have appeared there (although [Menace](https://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2013/10/menace.html) was published after the book and is thus missing, give it a read, it's hilarious).

It's essentially a series of slice of life stories, describing the titular _Unfortunate Situations, Flawed Coping Mechanisms, Mayhem, and Other Things That Happened_. Allie Brosh is a bit screwed up, but honestly, that's okay.  

> Nobody can guarantee that it's going to be okay, but - and I don't know if this will be comforting to anyone else - the possibility exists that there's a piece of corn on a floor somewhere that will make you just as confused about why you were laughing as you have ever been about why you are depressed.

It makes perfect sense in context. I promise.  

Well. Slightly more sense.  

She's certainly got a rather dry, cynical, absolutely ridiculous view of the world that I identify with all too much. And it's funny. Sometimes in direct ways, sometimes surreal, sometimes in those ways that will hit you hours after you're done reading.  

> No one could tell me not to eat an entire cake—not my mom, not Santa, not God—no one. It was my cake and everyone else could go fuck themselves.

Spoilers: She ate the cake.  

Check it out, either the book or the [blog](https://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/). You'll figure out right quick if you'll love it or not.
