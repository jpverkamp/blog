Getting a bit harder to find things to say. The Aurora/Celestia/their crews may have kicked the Jung off the Earth for now, but there's an entire fleeting coming their way and not nearly enough time to do everything they really need to defeat them.  

All sorts of ridiculous (both in the crazy and the awesome sense of the word) space battles and of course eventually the Aurora will save the day--but at what cost. The idea of the Jung bombing entire cities out of existence out of little more than spite and to deny them to the Terrans escalates the scale of battle yet again.

Another solid entry on the series, although at some point the Aurora/Celestia are going to have to take the fight to the Jung. A defensive war against an empire with who knows how many star systems worth of resources to draw on is a losing battle. I just hope it doesn't take the rest of the series to get there...
