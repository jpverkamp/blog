{{< goodreads book="Freedom's Dawn" text=" Freedom's Dawn " >}} continues the Frontiers Saga as Captain Nathan and the crew of the Aurora find themselves a thousand light years from home, embroiled in a rebellion against the EVIL EMPIRE etc.  

One nice thing though is that with each book, we're getting more away from the Star Trek Voyager tropes of a crew far from home and their journey home--where nothing matters. In the case of The Frontiers Saga, actions have consequences and it really does feel that they're changing the world(s) with their actions, which I greatly appreciate.

In some ways, it's a lot like the Wheel of Time: if you read only the first book, you'll find mostly a rip off of Tolkien, but as you keep reading, you get so much more. The Frontiers Saga isn't quite as deep as the Wheel of Time (at least not yet), but I do appreciate how it's changing.  

One thing that I am continually surprised by in these books is how surprisingly brutal they can be at times. Descriptions of heads being  {{< spoiler >}}blown apart and brains boiling out{{< /spoiler >}}  ? Oy. It's not a problem per say, it just feels somewhat counter to the quick, light reads the books otherwise feel like.  

Oh, and that last minute twist? Good way to remember that these books really can't stand apart. Again, not the end of the world.  

Overall, a good book. I look forward to the {{< goodreads book="Rise of the Corinari" text=" Rise of the Corinari " >}} !
