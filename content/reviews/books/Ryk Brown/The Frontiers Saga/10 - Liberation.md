This was a pretty crazy book so far as progressing the story. The Aurora, Celestia, and their crews and allies have a long slog ahead of themselves to free the Earth from the Jung, but they all have one huge advantage: nine books worth of experience in using the jump drive in combat!  

There are battles galore, some people die, we get a few new allies and piles and piles of 'five minutes to impact, three to jump'. Everything you've come to know and except from a Frontiers Saga book. :D

That's really all there is to it. At this point, barring something atrocious, I'm going to finish the series. Onwards!
