I'm not entirely sure what to think about {{< goodreads book="A Lion to Guard Us" text=" A Lion to Guard Us " >}} . It's historical fiction: the story of three young children in London and later on a journey to the new world. The children never existed, but a lot of the events that that happened either could have happened (their life in London) or in a general (the _Sea Adventure_ was a real ship and the problems with it's journey and Jamestown are real history).  

For the most part, it's a depressing story. The children's father is an ocean away, their mother is sick (  {{< spoiler >}}and dies, to little surprise for older readers{{< /spoiler >}}  ), the family taking care of them is exploitive, their stand in father figure  {{< spoiler >}}also eventually dies{{< /spoiler >}}  , and they  {{< spoiler >}}get shipwrecked{{< /spoiler >}}  . On the other hand, I suppose it's a good way to teach the idea of 'no matter what life throws at you, just keep on keeping on'?

For such a lightweight, quick read (the chapters are *short*), not that much actually happens. It's not the best book, but my children enjoyed it well enough.  

Off to something more interesting next perhaps?
