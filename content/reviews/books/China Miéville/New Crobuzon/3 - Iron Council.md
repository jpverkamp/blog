[[Perdido Street Station|One in a city]], [[The Scar|one on a boat]]... and now one based around an entire civilization built around a 'perpetual train', putting down rails as it goes (and at times, tearing them up behind it). 

Man [[China Miéville]]() has some bonkers worldbuilding ideas. 

> I mean course you want a change, we want a change, but if a change ain’t godsdamn coming, then the next thing I wish is that I didn’t care.

Beyond that, we have a whole book about political oppression and xenophobia (the Iron Council is initially founded by the remade working on the train). It's about the tension of a revolution that feels inevitable. We have a story about gender differences (in a world where sexual dimorphism is a huge deal for some species) and love and longing. And a story about future history. The messy way of how one ends up getting history books written about them. 

> “History...” Jacobs spoke with terse authority. Brought Ori to a hush. “Is all full. And dripping. With the corpses. Of them who trusted the incorruptible.” 

It's also interesting to see the fallout of the 'Contruct Uprising'. A direct consequence of [[Perdido Street Station]](). And now instead, we have [[wiki:golems]]()--which in this world can be made by animating any sorts of bits of innanimate matter and giving them life/instructions. It's cool!

Unfortunately, I think this may be the weakest of the three. Despite how cool an idea a 'perpetual train' is, I think the story spends too much time on other people/places/things. It's all building up, but when one of the things I love the most (and always start by describing) is left wanting? That's a bit of a bummer. It's still fascinating and there's a bunch of it... but I wanted more!
