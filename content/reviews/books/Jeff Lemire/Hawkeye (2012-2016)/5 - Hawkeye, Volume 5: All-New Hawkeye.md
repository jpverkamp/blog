Project Communion--whatever that is. The implication that S.H.I.E.L.D. isn’t really much better than H.Y.D.R.A. sometimes. Hawkeyes!

It’s a solid mostly self contained adventure. I enjoyed it. 

Not a huge fan of the pastel flashbacks. Hard to read at best. The story is neat—origin story!—but I want to skip it just because of the style.
