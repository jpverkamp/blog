Old Man Logan is in the past… but it’s not his past. 

Fearing what could come, he goes to the one place be feels he can do the most good: to guard his future wife?

Yeah… I’m not sure what else he thought might happen. 

Luckily, a few big fights, a pile of blood and bodies, and a visit with a young old friend later and he seems to get the idea. 

Onward!
