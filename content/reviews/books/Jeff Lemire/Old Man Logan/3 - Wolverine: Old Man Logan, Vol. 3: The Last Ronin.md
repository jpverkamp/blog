title: 'Wolverine: Old Man Logan, Vol. 3: The Last Ronin'
---
Old Man Logan—on the trail of Lady Deathstrike—goes to Japan. Only to square off another piece of goes future past. 

It’s fascinating seeing Logan’s past, everything between when the villains took over and when he got sent to the Battleworlds, intermixed with the current present. 

Fascinating… and bloody. But that’s Wolverine for you.

So… what’s the Japanese word for Bub exactly?
