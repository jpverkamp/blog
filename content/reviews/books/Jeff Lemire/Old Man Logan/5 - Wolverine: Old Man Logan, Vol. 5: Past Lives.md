Memories of the past/future…

And he wants to go back. 

This can’t possibly go well. 

Especially when none of his “friends” will help, so he has to turn to darker sources. 

What we end up with is Logan bouncing (again) through time, reliving his old adventures for a few pages at a time, unable to change anything that matters. 

It’s an interesting idea, but once again it doesn’t really have time to breath. All too soon, we’re back to the status quo.
