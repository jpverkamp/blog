**Author's Foreward** :  

_You might not want to buy this book._ ...  

<!--more-->

Yeah... I thought we were going to get a little more insight into the world of the Kingkiller Chronicles. A little more about the University. A little more about Auri.  

I guess one out of three ain't bad?  

Basically, it's Auri being strange and re-arranging junk. Also there's a riveting scene of  {{< spoiler >}}Auri making soap{{< /spoiler >}}  .  

On the more positive side, there is some rather beautiful wordplay here. That's one thing that Rothfuss can do particularly well: wrote evocative descriptions.  

Honestly, I found the Endnote the most interesting. A star just for that. It's always interesting to see into the mind of a writer. I didn't find the story itself _"disconcerting, off-putting, or confusing"_ but rather odd and boring. So it goes. It _probably just wasn't for [me]_ .  

**Author's Endnote** :  

... _If you're one of the peopel who found this story disconcerting, off- putting, or confusing, I apologize. The truth is, it probably just wasn't for you. The good news is that there are many other stories out there that are written for you. Stories that you will enjoy much more._  

_This story is for all the slightly broken people out there._  

_I am one of you. You are not alone. You are all beautiful to me._
