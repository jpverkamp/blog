So… Hawk-Owl. Right.  Big time Batman parody, no?

That’s an introduction.

And… that’s a backstory. 

He’s rich and fights crime in a winged outfit. And has an adopted boy sidekick. 

It’s cute. The big bad is so weird. The characters are one dimensional and not great people. I’m not really sure why it’s a thing other than a weird Ultimates cameo that doesn’t go anywhere.

So it goes. 

Onward.
