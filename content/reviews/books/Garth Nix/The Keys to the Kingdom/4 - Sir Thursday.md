Not much to say. Onwards and upwards for Arthur, taking on another of the Trustees and gaining another of the Keys.  

Pretty much all of the problems in this book seemed overly easy to subdue, the Skinless Boy and Sir Thursday included. I think this has been going on for all of the rest of the books, but it seemed even more obvious in this one. Perhaps it's a factor of how relatively short they are?

Although on the flip side, setting things up with  {{< spoiler >}}the Piper{{< /spoiler >}}  was interesting. I expected him to show up at some point, but this was a little different.  

Also Dame Primus is totally going to be a problem. Called it here.
