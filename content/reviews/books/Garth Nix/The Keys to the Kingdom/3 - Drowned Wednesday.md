The world of the Keys to the Kingdom continues to get more interesting and weirder all at once. This time around, we have a sort of Multiversal Ocean and the Morrow Day that governs it. It's an interesting world all itself, with ships that were once other things, uplifted rats, and a very Nix'ian version of the Jonah and Whale story.  

It's neat to finally see one of the Morrow Days that actually wants to help. I'm guessing we won't see much of that with the other half.

Also, oh snap that cliff hanger at the end. These really are seven parts of a seven part serialized novel. Nothing wrong with that though. It's an interesting style. I wonder if Nix wrote all seven of them before publishing?
