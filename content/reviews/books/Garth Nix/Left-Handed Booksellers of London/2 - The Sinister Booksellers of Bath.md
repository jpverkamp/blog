title: The Sinister Booksellers of Bath
---
I quite enjoyed [[The Left-Handed Booksellers of London]](), but I'll admit, I was a bit surprised to see that there actually was a sequel. I quite often find myself, after reading a book, wondering--but what happened next?!

Well, here we go!

For the most part, The Sinister Booksellers of Bath (I do love the titles of these), is more of the same. Susan has been trying to go on and lead a normal life... nope. Back into the magic! Merlin and Vivien are off doing magical things... and stumble into trouble, needing Susan to help them out. 

I do love reading about the three of them. I think Susan, growing and changing and coming to terms with her powers is really the heart of these stories and I'm hoping for even more. 

The worldbuilding remains fantastical in a way that Garth Nix is so good at. We have a wonderful blend of real world and an underlying magic, with ancient powers, magical artifcats, and statues coming to life. 

Overall, I'm surprised but pleasantly so that the Left-Handed Booksellers had a sequel. If there's ever a third in the future, I'll most certainly give it a chance. 

But for now, onward!
