title: Betsy-Tacy and Tib
---
Betsy-Tacy and Tib is ... pretty much exactly what you'd expect. It's [[Betsy-Tacy]](), but now with more Tib. A new girl moves in, they become instant best friends, hijinks ensue. 

Once again, it's a delightful book to read with my own little one. I enjoy seeing what messes the children get into. And although they do get in trouble from time to time, we're reminded that *it's okay to be children*. 

Side note: my absolute favorite story is when they decide to cook. It goes as well as one might expect! :smile:
