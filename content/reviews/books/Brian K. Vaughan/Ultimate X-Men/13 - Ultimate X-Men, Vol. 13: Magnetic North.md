title: 'Ultimate X-Men, Vol. 13: Magnetic North'
---
Another magnetic mutant at Frostâ€™s school loses control of her powers (or did she?) 

Doesnâ€™t matter! Lock her up with Magneto!

Nothing can possibly go wrong. 

A solid volume, with some mutants facing off, X-Men vs the Ultimates, and all sorts of trouble setting up for another day. 

Onward!

Notes. Spoilers.

Emma Frost having her own school thatâ€™s more a school than excuse to train a super team is a neat plot line.

They _have_ to have a better option than that.

Although Iâ€™ll admit that was not the problem I expected with it. Accidentally setting Magneto free as well by trying to help their friend. Oy. 

Also mutants looking down on the Ultimates for not being mutants is greatly amusing. I hope we see that.
