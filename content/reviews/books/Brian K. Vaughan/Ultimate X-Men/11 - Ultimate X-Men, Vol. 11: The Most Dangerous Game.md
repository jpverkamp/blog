title: 'Ultimate X-Men, Vol. 11: The Most Dangerous Game'
---
A mutant on a far away island, being hunted as fuel for a 24x7 reality show. 

Bit on the name with that title’s reference, no?

Anyways, of course the X-Men have to come to the rescue… even if they’ve been explicitly told not to. 

A decent volume. Onward!

Isn’t that the name of a big mutant that defends the Institute in All New X-Men?

I understood that reference!
