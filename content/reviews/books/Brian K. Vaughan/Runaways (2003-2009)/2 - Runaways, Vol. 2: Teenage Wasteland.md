And so the team grows. 

They’re so amusingly teenager. Angst and boy / girl issues contrasting against their parents trying to find / capture / kill then. Good times.

It’s fun watching them try to grow up fast. I have no idea how they end up getting out of this mess… or what their parents are really up to. 

Which is the best part!

Onward!
