You know, I didn’t expect turning 18 and then *immediately* turning to the dark side as a plot line. Fits though.

But he at last has *good intentions* and all that?

So of course it’s up to friends old and new to try to stop Chase from doing any number of dumber than average even for him things. 

A solid story. 

Onwards!

The honesty of youth. The Karolina and Xavin plotline is fun though. I wonder / expect that their own series somewhere?
