---
The one where Karolina is apparently engaged to someone from way out of town, Cloak and Dagger are back and need help (field trip!), and we get a few moments of some of the Big Names in Marvel. 

It’s a cute story, well contained with a bit leading up to what’s coming I’m looking forward to… but Karolina just vanishing into space was… kind of weird. I like her. Hope she’s back soon. 

Onward!

Not sure I’ll ever get used completely comics suddenly completely switching to different art styles.

That’s a thing? Of course that’s a thing.

Poof. Rrrr? I like how get spells have to be unique. I wonder if language matters.

Delightful.

Go Molly! Also… reading in no particular order does lead to a lot of questions. Where are all the mutants?
