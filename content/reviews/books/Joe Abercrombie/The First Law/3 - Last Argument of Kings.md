> I have learned all kinds of things from my many mistakes. The one thing I never learn is to stop making them.

And so it ends... for now. Some of our old friends (more or less) are dead, some are broken, and some ... miraculously seem to have gotten everything they wanted in life. There are more surprises and political shifts than one knows how to deal with, a chunk more of world building around the First and Second Laws, and all manner of battles and death and destruction. 

It remains fascinating what Abercrombie can do with characters. Glokta is a terrible person--and he makes us root for him. Logen is a berserker in the truest sense--and he makes us feel sorry for him. Jezal is excellent at failing upward--and he makes us feel sorry for him. It's all around amazing and the real strength of the series.

Well worth the read. I think I'll try to mix in something perhaps just a *little* less dark for a while (also until the next book comes up at the library). We shall see.
