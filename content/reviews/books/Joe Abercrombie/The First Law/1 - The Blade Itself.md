> Every man has his excuses, and the more vile the man becomes, the more touching the story has to be. What is my story now, I wonder?

Joe Abercrombie / The Blade Itself have long held a highly recommended spot on my to read lis, so when I caught the audiobook on Libby/the Indiana Digital Library[^idl] I figured it was about time. 

Quick version: it's wonderful, but also *very* dark. One of the main characters is a barbarian who's family was recently killed, another is a soldier crippled in war turned torturer. And somehow, Abercrombie actually really makes you feel for the both of them, but man it takes a bit... On top of that, there's some fascinating hints of magic--plus some more overt examples, no less terrible, when we meet Bayaz--the First of the Magi... or is he?

> History is littered with dead good men.

Overall, it's a great listen (the narrator took a minute to catch hold, but once he did I loved it) and I'd assume a great read. I will warn you though (if you haven't caught it by now), there are a fair few troubling scenes in this book. If that isn't your thing, perhaps give it a pass? 

I'm really curious where it will go next!

> Well. What can we do, except try to do better?

[^idl]: If you live in Indiana, [check it out](https://www.in.gov/library/services-for-libraries/indiana-digital-library/). Recently many (all?) of the various library programs got together to offer one single collection of ebooks/audiobooks for digital borrowing and it's awesome. The selection is *far* better than the local one (just outside of the county lines to use the Indianapolis library system).
