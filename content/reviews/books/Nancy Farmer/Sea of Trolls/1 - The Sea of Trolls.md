Well that's a surprisingly fun book! 

In a nutshell:

> The year is A.D. 793; Jack and his sister have been kidnapped by Vikings and taken to the court of Ivar the Boneless and his terrifying half-troll wife; but things get even worse when Jack finds himself on a dangerous quest to find the magical Mimir's Well in a far-off land, with his sister's life forfeit if he fails.

I started out reading this since it's a great (and rare) fit for the [[2024 Book Bingo]]() 'Bard' square, since both Jack and his mentor are explicitly called 'Bards' (even if, interestingly music is a relatively small part of their training), but it ends up being so much more. 

It's got Vikings--including digging into what makes them who they are and how they think differently from the people Jack grew up with. 

> Just say no to pillaging.

It's got monsters--the Vikings for one, along with Trolls (sometimes more human that anyone), dragons, ravens, and giant spiders. 

> “Norns keep the tree Yggdrassil alive. Without them, nothing would exist… They show up when you're born and decide what kind of life you're going to have."  
> "I guess they were in a rotten mood when I came along," Jack said. He loaded up the water bag and supplies.  
> "Me too," Thorgil said gravely.  

> Look around you...Feel the wind, smell the air. Listen to the birds and watch the sky. Tell me what's happening in the wide world.

It's got magic. Bardic magic. Shapeshifting. Talking to animals. Calling up / banishing storms. Norse mythology. Norns. Yggdrasil. 

> “It's my fault," said Rune. "He's untrained and likely to overdo things."  
> "Like turning the queen bald. That was a good trick, though." Olaf smiled.” 

I've absolutely no idea if it's particularly historically accurate (barring the above of course :)), but it's a fun read and I greatly enjoyed it. Now I really want to know what happens next!

Side note: Great fun for an audiobook, lightly accented. Just enough to get into the feel of the book all the more!
