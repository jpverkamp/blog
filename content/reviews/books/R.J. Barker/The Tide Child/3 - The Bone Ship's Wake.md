> And what is life for us if we are not lurching from one life-or-death situation to another?

Maes is MIA and Joron picks up the slack in quite the way--as the well named Black Pirate. It's such a huge growth to see from him, from the very beginning when he and Maes first met and probably the best part of the books. 

It's also great to see how the increasing worldbuilding around the Guillame and the Keyshan come to bear. There's a lot more there than the reader or the characters really had to deal with at first. 

On the other hand, I do feel somewhat let down by the latter half of the book. There's an awful lot of interesting in the beginning; however, as everything builds and builds, despite plenty of action--the story just sort of ends. I feel like there could have been more, but so it goes. 

<!--more-->

Overall, a series worth reading, for the world building in particular. I'm about ready to move on though. Onward!
