title: Call of the Bone Ships
---
*[[The Bone Ships]]()* introduced us to the world--where the bones of gigantic sea dragons once provided the building materials for ships, with hints of something even darker and more interesting going on in the background.

*Call of the Bones Ships* takes up that up another level, really digging more into the often twisted politics and future of the world. It manages to give us quite a bit more insight into Joron Twiner, who is forced rather handedly to come into his own--with whatever that ends up meaning--and torturing him rather much along the way. We also get a lot of more of the gullaime (and the Gullaime specifically). There's still a lot more to unpack there, so I'm looking for the third. 

It ends up being rather a darker book, which fits even better as the successor to the series. 

Overall, wonderful worldbuilding, a darker tone, fascinating characters, and worth the re-read. Onward!
