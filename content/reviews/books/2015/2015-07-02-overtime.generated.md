Heh. Santa Claus is a nasty beastie.  

Overtime is a fun little story about the Horrors of Christmas and builds just a bit more onto the world of the Laundry Files. It's weird how much authority the night watchman has, but it also makes a certain kind of sense.

While I tend to like novels more than short stories, I'm not sure this would have been able to use the extra space. Nicely self contained.  

I particularly liked the wibbly wobbly bits towards the end. Cosmic horror tends more towards alternate realities than true time travel, and I think this was an amusing example there of.
