I'm pretty sure that Arthur died. He had a massive asthma attack, and, as his oxygen starved brain struggled its last, he hallucinated all of the rest. How else do you describe just how ... odd this book is.  

That being said, I liked it. It's weird. Garth Nix really does his Proper Nouns. Everything felt like it Meant Something, although we never quite got a perfect idea what Anything was. Most of them were close enough though; so it goes. It's quick and the action picks you up and pulls you right through the story. When it's over, there's something of a feel of getting off a roller coaster, but in a good way.

Final thoughts: Is this series really going to take place over a week (Earth time)? All righty then.  

Let's do it.
