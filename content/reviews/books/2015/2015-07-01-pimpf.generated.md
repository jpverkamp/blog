{{< goodreads book="Pimpf" cover="true" >}}

Not nearly as strong as the other Laundry Files short story I've read, Pimpf basically talks about Bob taking on an intern and fighting real(ish) life demons inside a copy of Neverwinter Nights.  

There were plenty of references and a nice does of cosmic madness, but I just didn't get as much into it as I did the Concrete Jungle (let alone the full novels). So it goes.
