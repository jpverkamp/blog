Of course they're all going to take place over a week (Earth time)...  

There's really not much different between Mister Monday and Grim Tuesday. Arthur is starting to accept his fate while at the same time learning more about the rules of the House. It interesting to see him change even in just the first two books thus far.

It's nice to see a bit more of Suzy and also a bit more of the House. I see how they're going to have a different setting and antagonist each day, with an overarching world to tie them together. It's a neat idea and I want to see it all of the way through.  

Also, apparently the Morrow Days are the 7 Deadly Sins? Was that ever explicitly mentioned? Sloth and Greed down, 5 to go.
