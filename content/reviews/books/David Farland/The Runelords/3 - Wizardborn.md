Man these stories keep escalating. It's really kind of impressive. From the story of a powerful invading lord to bugs from the depths of the Earth to dark magic, super powerful evil beings from another world, and perhaps even worse... Man there's a lot here.  

On top of that, we're digging a lot more into the various magic systems of this universe. Averan is  {{< spoiler >}}Earth Wizardborn and can eat the brains of Reavers to learn from them{{< /spoiler >}}  , which gives us a much better idea of how the Revears work internally. We're seeing a lot more about the Air powers, along with the continued Earth (Gaborn) and Fire (Raj Ahten). Even Water, although that's a bit more subtle thus far (which fits).

Craziest of all... the end of the world is coming in five days (according to Gaborn's feelings). And this story doesn't even cover all that yet. It's a hefty book, for how little time it covers. It just keeps escalating!

One of the best stories we get... Borenson and Myrrima. I could most definiately do without the near constant mentions of 'walnuts' (seriously... it feels like half the story at times), but the way they grow (both individually and together) is pretty cool.  

Looking forward to where the story goes next!
