> Which is how I ended up being the only one who could help. As a null, I don’t have any particular magic powers—just the opposite, really. I negate all the magic within a certain radius around me, creating a magic-free bubble that has me as its center. In theory, if Marko stayed within that area, I could keep him human for a short time, and he and his wife could make a baby the old-fashioned way. Assuming, of course, we could all get past the extreme awkwardness that would be involved.

> It was weird, but it was far from the weirdest thing I’d done lately. The leaders of the Los Angeles vampires, werewolves, and witches all paid me a retainer to clean up supernatural problems that arose in the city. When things were quiet, as they’d been for the past couple of months, I was free to pick up freelance work.

> Most of the time this involved shepherding vampires around during daylight activities, but two weeks earlier, I had been paid to attend a witch’s beach volleyball tournament so I could make sure her opponent wasn’t using magic to cheat. A few days before that, I’d accompanied a crowd-shy werewolf to a taping of his favorite sitcom, to help him stay calm in the midst of all that teeming humanity. I might have actually enjoyed that outing, except the sitcom was one of those “fat slovenly husband vs. shrill anorexic wife” crapfests. Freelance work could be kind of a gamble.

This series is wonderful.  

Scarlett goes to Las Vegas (which is a vampire haven) to look into two vampires flagrantly breaking the Old World rules using their powers to ... put on a Vegas show of all things. And also keep a bachelorette party safe. But it's all for a purpose in the end. One thing leads to another, a bunch of vampires die, and Scarlett has to save the day. And then kill a new friend, because that's what she promised.  

> I rolled my eyes. Ah yes, Old World politics. You can’t attack someone with a perfectly acceptable story, even if you think they’re lying. It’s not like putting up a controversial Facebook post. Proof is the only thing that matters.

Scarlett remains the big draw of this books, still just as snarky:  

> “And your solution was ‘violence is never the answer’?” I said, amused.  
>
> “Well, it isn’t,” he said defensively.  
>
> “Unless the question is, ‘What is never the answer?’” I pointed out.  
>
> There was a pause, and then Jesse said, “Did you actually need something?”  

And complicated:  

> Life is funny. Wait, scratch that. People say that all the time, but what they really mean is that life is cruel, tragic, and unfair—but not without a sense of humor about it.

Well worth the read. I totally can guess where the next book is going...
