After getting tossed into the world of the supernatural in {{< goodreads book="Boundary Crossed" >}}, Lex is back and starting to learn just why everyone seems to be out to get her in {{< goodreads book="Boundary Lines" >}}.  

Someone is stirring up local magic, brining back magical beasties from an age long gone and driving the (semi-)local werewolf mad. We get a good amount of world building, learning a fair bit more about the werewolves and finally seeing a second boundary mage--even if she died a long time ago. We get a bit more characterization of the other witches and vampires, a bit more on the local politics and tensions between the various supernatural factions. Neat worldbuilding all around and a few decent plot twists.

Characterwise, I still think Lex is a decent protagonist, especially now that she's not just learning about everything for the first time. She still has a bit of a problem with actually using the knowledge of those who actually know what they're talking about in the supernatural world, but I think that works as part of her character.  

I like Quinn a lot more this time around. He's definitely there primarily as love interest (which we get a bit more of this time around, albeit still not that much), but he feels more 'real' this time time time around.  

> “Please visualize me hitting you with a pillow,” Quinn grumbled, “as I currently lack the strength.”

The new witches (Lily and Simon's older sisters) don't really seem to have much going for them, but so it goes. At least we get a bit more insight into the local witches.  

Overall, it's a solid extension to the series. There's nothing hugely new or innovative here, but better than the first by a decent margin (I think mostly because we aren't just starting out fresh) and it's a good read.
