A cute addition to the series. The Borrowers have made it to Little Fordham. We get a bit of backstory about the maker of the tiny town and of course there's a baddie making a town of his own. The Borrowers get Borrowernapped, they learn how to make a balloon, and they soar back home.  

There's a lot to like about this series, especially the miniature worlds and how the Borrowers can use any manner of things in ways we never intended them. It's a fun world.

Worth the read. One more, onward!
