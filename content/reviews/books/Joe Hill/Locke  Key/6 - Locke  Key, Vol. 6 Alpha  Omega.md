One more story.

And man. It grabs hold and it does *not* let go.  

We finally get the showdown we've been expecting since the beginning of the story. Dodge/Zach/Luke/the Echo/whatever he/she/it is versus the Lockes and their friends...  

And it is *not* a pleasant battle. As things go from bad to worse, I kept excepting something like a true 'time travel' key or a 'it was all a dream' moment. But this... this is not that sort of story.  

Man. Don't get me wrong, it's a wonderfully written and illustrated story and I'm glad to have read it, but a lof of that ending is a downer...  

There are a few solid moments before we say goodbye though.

Heh. They finally said it.  

Quite a ride. Well worth the read.
