Well that's certainly one way for a story to start.  

<!--more-->

Locke and Key tells the story of the Locke family. Dad was murdered, mom and kids return to the ancestral Keyhouse family home--and things *start* getting weird from there. There's mystery and magic, complete with more than a touch of horror. What else would you expect with a New England town named Lovecraft...  

The creepy mystery of it all really does pull you through the story, made all the better by a variety of different viewpoints. When your kid brother (who just lost his father) tells you about a door that lets him die and fly around as a ghost, you think he's just processing. But when you see the story from the kid's (Bode's) viewpoint, you know that something far more interesting is going on...  

And of course... hints of something more.

Oh, I'm looking forward to see where this goes from here!
