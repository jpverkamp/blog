So it's not just keys... it's crowns and other artifacts too now? That's cool! They're all still vaguely key related, so it works out.

Man Dodge/Zach/Luke/whatever his name is makes a somewhat terrifying foe. He actually *knows* what's going on with the keys and has managed to get the Locke children to (more or less) trust him. Oh that's going to explode.  

One thing that I enjoyed particularly about this volume was the introduction of a few new characters.

He's great. :D  

It's fascinating to be hit again with the idea that these kids are just that-- kids. Man they've been through so much and you know that things are *not* going to get better before they get worse.
