title: 'Ultimate Galactus, Volume 3: Extinction'
---
And so it ends. Galactus is here, ready to destroy the Earth and everything on it. Itâ€™s going to take Ultimates, Fantastic Four, and X-Men alike to save the day. 

But at what future cost?

A bit sudden of an end and in prefer the setup of the previous two volumes, but itâ€™s still solid. 

There are a number of potential far future issues laid out here. Curious what comes back to bite humanityâ€™s collective behind. 

Onward!

Notes. Or else.

I wonder if living in the crazy world they do makes believing in God easier or harder.

Oh boy. Just wait another decade or two. World gets weird yo.

Vision is repaired? Andâ€¦ golden? And presenting somewhat more female than in the movies. Interesting.

Thatâ€¦ is delightfully bonkers. I wonder if thatâ€™s going to mess up the universe stack somehow. If thatâ€™s something theyâ€™ll deal with at some point later, or just gloss over. 

Not that thatâ€™s the only fallout potentially waiting for us.
