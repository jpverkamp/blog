There’s so much to unpack from the events of Ultimatum…

So instead let’s introduce some new foe in the Mandarin. Hacking in and taking over Stark Tech. The Iron Man suit. 

Neat idea but feels incomplete. Both in what I expected post Ultimatum and in the resolution. 

Onward.

The Mandarin! Interesting.

That’s an unexpected look for Jarvis.

Not… War Machine?
