Clint is in over his head. Again. Tracksuit mafia. Managing a building. Installing AV equipment. Valentineâ€™s Day. Women.

The dog gets it. 

Poor {{<spoiler>}}Gil{{</spoiler>}}. :/

Itâ€™s a neat story, if somewhat incomplete. 

Onward!

More thoughts (spoilers):

Thatâ€™s quite the team. On one hand, itâ€™s not literal Norse god / a Hulk. But they still have straight up super human powers. And Wolverine is basically immortal. Soâ€¦ why Hawkeye?

Itâ€™s funny because ~Grills~ just calls Clint Hawkguy anyways.

Thatâ€™s a delightful visual. I actually really like Hawkeye with the Avengers, but not currently **with** the Avengers stories.

Wait, who is the ex? Bobbi? I vaguely remember a Bobbi from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (the show). So much to backfill. 

Also, Jessica? As in Jones? I should read those.
