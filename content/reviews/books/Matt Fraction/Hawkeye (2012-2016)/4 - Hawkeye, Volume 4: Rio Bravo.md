Down on his luck, eh? Oh the fallout from buying the building. Standing up to the goons. Poor {{<spoiler>}}Gil{{</spoiler>}}. :/

In comics everything ends up connected. 

And we get deaf Hawkeye storyline. Not quite the same as the show, but its neat seeing inspirations. 

It’s quite the story and good to see some closure of sorts. For now.
