The Avengers donâ€™t really make any senseâ€¦ Hawkeye least of all. Itâ€™s the Disney+ series in a nutshell. Letâ€™s see how the comics did it firstâ€¦

Okay, so I can see how the bones are the same, but itâ€™s a different story. Hawkeye (s)? Check. Clint and Kate. Theyâ€™re cute together; platonically. Dog? Check. Tracksuit mafia? Bro. Fisk? CHECK. Bad guy auction? Check. 

Overall, itâ€™s really good. Iâ€™m looking forward to where this goes next!

A few more thoughts as I read. Spoilers!

Well thatâ€™s a start.

So in the comics, he can do more than arrows? Thatâ€™s a neat trick.

Not exactly the same story then. Got the same bones, but Kate Bishop is already introduced.

Their relationship is kind of wonderful. I do so hope they actually keep it platonic. Is Hawkeye married with a family in the comics?

Also, weird outfit. 

Also also, Clint geeking out about all the random arrowsâ€¦ I love it.

Speaking of outfitsâ€¦ thatâ€™s hilarious.

Thatâ€™s quite the art style swap.
