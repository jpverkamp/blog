> For every nine years, the fold from Beyond the Wall and over the hill set up their stalls, and for a day and a night the meadow played host to the Faerie market; and there was, for one day and one night in nine years, commerce between the nations.

I do love Neil Gaiman[^americangods]. He does weird/creepy/dark perfectly well. Stardust is a great example of *exactly* that. 

It's a dark fairy tale, a la the Brothers Grimm. A city on the border between Victorian England and Fairie. The contrast of worlds. An adventure full of princes and witches, woodland animals, magic, and of course: fairy tale love.

It's a great listen. A bit weird, since apparently it was also originally published in graphic novel format and is also supposed to be a great movie. Looks like I'm going to have to go through it a few more times.

Side note: "Eight children seven boys." Sneaky. I love how they didn't go into exactly what that might mean for rather a while longer!

[^americangods]: For whatever reason, I bounced hard off American Gods. I liked the show; less so the book.
