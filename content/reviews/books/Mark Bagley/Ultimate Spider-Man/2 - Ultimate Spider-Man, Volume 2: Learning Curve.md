title: 'Ultimate Spider-Man, Volume 2: Learning Curve'
---
Spider-Man starts to settle in to his new life. School, a job, a bit of light vigilantism, perhaps a date with MJâ€¦

and of course decides to set his sights on the big man himself: Mr. Fisk. Kingpin. Heâ€™s a personal favorite big (heh) bad of mine. So Iâ€™m looking forward to where this goes. 

Also Iâ€™m enjoying the teenage dynamic. So far as Iâ€™m concerned they nailed it. Itâ€™s insane, what heâ€™s trying to doâ€¦ but it feels so right. 

Onward!

Cute. 

I hope they get at least a few good moments before everything goes as sideways as I expect. 

Itâ€™s nice to see Peter not completely clueless.

Not the best insults. Especially given such a big target.

Spider-Dolt.

Anâ€¦ interesting strategy. And he even brought notecards. 

And it even workedâ€¦

Huh. Interesting. Okay, I hope this sticks, Iâ€™d like to see him with some backup.
