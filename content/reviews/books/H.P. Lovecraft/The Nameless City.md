So. That's Lovecraft.  

This is the first of his that I've read (complete works for 99Â¢ on Amazon), although I'm relatively familiar with the mythos. It's interesting

The descriptions are intense and there is actually a feeling of something horrible lurking just beneath the surface. There's basically nothing in the way of character or interaction though, either to give depth or take away from the descriptions so take that as you will.  

I'm curious how the longer works well fare.
