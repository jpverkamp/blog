References abound to things I've heard of before. Arkham. The Necronomicon. The mad Arab Abdul Alhazred. Miskatonic University.  

Is the narrator the same man as in The Nameless City? No idea. Feels like not. But it's certainly a shared universe. One with an impressive feeling of size for only a pair of short stories thus far.

Overall, there's a big more character here. The narrator has a sliver of personality. They interact with their surroundings rather than just going on a terrible ride. It makes for a fast stronger story in my opinion.  

I see why some people really love the world and extended mythos Lovecrafy begat.
