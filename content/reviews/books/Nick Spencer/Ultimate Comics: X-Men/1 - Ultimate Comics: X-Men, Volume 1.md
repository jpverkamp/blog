…

So mutants? Not in a great place after Magneto’s wave. 

The ones  that are left are on the run and there are more than a few factions teeing to hunt them down. 

And as if that weren’t enough, add in the new forces in SEAR. And others. 

Oh it’s a wonderful mess. Dark. But it has potential. 

Onward!
