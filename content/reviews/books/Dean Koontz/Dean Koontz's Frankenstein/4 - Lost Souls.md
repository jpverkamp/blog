> Pride can become arrogance. Arrogance is the father of cruelty. But in the beginning, there was also an idealism, a hope that he could change the human condition.

Victor Helios (né Frankenstein) is dead. Victor Leben (né Helios (né Frankenstein)) is *alive*. 

With the events at the end of {{<crosslink "Dead and Alive">}}, we all knew there would be another book. Here it is! 

It's ... fine. It's got all the bits you'd need for a thriller, but I don't feel the villains as much. And there's *not really and ending*. It's very much part 1 of 2. At this point, you could easily stop at book 3... or read on to finish book 5. I suppose I'm in the latter camp. Onward!

Rather than New Orleans and genetic engineering, we have small down Montana and nanotech. It's the same story in a different setting. 

Plotwise... there's no ending. After 3 books of it... I shouldn't have expected better. Perhaps with the next book being the last, we'll finally get one? But I doubt it. 

Characterwise, we still have Deucalion, all the more teleporty and murderous--but only of the bad guys. We really need *so much more* with him. What is it like to be Frakenstein's monster? To live for hundreds of years? There are hints, but still. Not nearly enough. 

We still have Carson and Michael, but now they have a child (who they leave behind). I still enjoy their banter and they theoretically have more to lose now... but it's a bit much. 

We still have Erika 5 and Jocko--and Jocko is *not* any better. I still don't get the way Koontz went with that. At all. 

And we have a whole new cast. A migrant thief. A young man with a lower than average IQ and a heart of gold. An old man and a little boy at the hospital. The locals--not nearly as willing to let themselves be taken over. Not without a fight. 'murica yo. 

And of course a wide variety of the monsters. They're basically all obsessive machines--who pretend they're perfect--and Victor--who has basically no personality this time around. It's a bummer. Victor the first, as mad as he was, was actually a pretty solid antagonist. Victor the clone... less so. 

Like I said, it's fine. I enjoyed it while I was reading it. And I'll read the sequel. But there are better books out there. better Koontz even. Onward.
