Spider-Man!

In a somewhat less far future than when this super was first written… 30 years ago. 

A future with no super heroes. Only the memory of those like Thor…

As a sort of religion? It’s an interesting bit of world building. I fully expect Spiderlings before the end of this volume… (so close!)

And an origin story. A new Spider-Man—Miguel O’Hara. Created in a lab “accident” after trying to quit a twisted bio engineering project.

He said the line!

Baddies? We have a forgettable cyborg. And one… somewhat less forgettable. A samurai, possibly from … Stark-Fujikawa? A mysterious shadowy—very large—boss in the shadows. The Vulture. Downtown Freakers. Hints at even more. 

It’s quite an origin story. I’m enjoying jumping into another new world so far!

Onward!
