Eugenics man? [[wiki:Lamarckism]]() Guy?

Or Mutagen I suppose. 

Bent on eradicating genetic diseases… somewhat directly. With the power to adapt quickly to any threat. Interesting enough villain!

Plus we get an issue or two each with SIEGE (Iron Man as a cop?) and [[wiki:Thanatos]]() (certainly seems to believe himself to be anyways).

There’s a lot of chaos in this volume, but it’s enjoyable. I'm not a *huge* fan of the older style... and this has decades over the very beginning of comics. We'll see where we go next. But for now, more Spider-Man!

Side note:

Convenient that.
