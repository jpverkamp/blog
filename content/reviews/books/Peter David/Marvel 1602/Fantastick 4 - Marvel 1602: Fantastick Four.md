The Four of the Fantastick. A story I’m more or less familiar with, only from various movies rather than the comics. Here, they’re in the world created by time travel to 1602. Doom wants to travel beyond the edge of the world to heal his face and takes Shakespeare along for the ride. 

An interesting enough story. Weird to involve Shakespeare. 

Onward!

A few thoughts / Minor spoilers:

And then… Shakespeare.

The Invisible Woman, pregnant. That’s a thing. 

Also, I enjoy the translucent text boxes. More obvious later when she speaks more at once.
