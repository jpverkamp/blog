So, a new team. It’s… certainly not the Ultimates, despite the name. More of a Spidey and Friends. 

But you know? It works. 

It’s a lot more local level, where Spider-Man really shines. It’s fun seeing Bombshell grown up a bit. Cloak and Dagger are great. Yay Jessica Drew. 

And yay ish Kitty Pride? She’s been there since just about the beginning. Pretty crazy to think. 

Anyways. I enjoyed it. Name doesn’t fit. Art (especially faces) is a bit off. But I enjoyed it. 

Onward!
