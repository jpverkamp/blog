Meh. It worked much better in Volume 1. 

Same team, same smaller stakes. Not going to lose states (again), but plenty of lives are on the line. 

It’s interesting seeing the team dynamics (on again, off again, half a dozen times in a single volume…). 

The art for this one got weird. 

The Ultimates name still doesn’t really work. 

And it’s weird that the Kate Bishop story line almost 100% got dropped. 

So it goes. 

Onward to the end.

Notes. Spoilers.

More different art, yet again!

I don’t think I’ve seen Cloak and Dagger as civilians. Given Dagger’s glowing eyes at the beach, I didn’t think they could. 

Haven’t seen them fighting either. Don’t like it.

Slightly more Ultimate, the FF. 

Sue doesn’t have a nose… Falcon doesn’t have a *face*.

Well…

I do like Drew’s new look.
