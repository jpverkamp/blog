Well that was a weird, wild, and chaotic ride. More than most comics even, this volume didn't feel like a volume so much as a series of vaguely connected issues. It's fun to see Coulson and S.H.I.E.L.D. doing their thing, but I honestly couldn't really get into the story before off we go again.

## Perfect Bullets

The Norse Worlds are coming to ~Earth~ Midgard one way or the other. Who better to stop them... then S.H.I.E.L.D.?

## The Animator

Read this [[Ms. Marvel, Vol. 3: Crushed|already]](). Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m reading this run of S.H.I.E.L.D.!

## Home Invasion

Spider-Man!

Also, Lola!

Also alsoï¿¼, the Sanctum Santorum. Quite a lot for one issue!

## Fuel

The Invisible Woman, prison breakerâ€¦

â€¦ and impromptu medical doctor. 

## Magic Bullets

Satanaâ€¦ daughter of Satan. 

Comic names (and outfits) are so ridiculous sometimes.

## Dark Dimensions

Oh hey. There was an overarching plot the whole time. 

Or something. 

A brain virus, staring at the highest IQ first.

Itâ€™s one of those â€˜
