Only <strike>one volume</strike> two volumes. Interesting. Let’s go!

Elektra making new friends at college.

And a younger than I’m used to Matt Murdock, already fighting crime and just starting in on the law stuff. 

Of course things escalate quickly and of course something has to drive them apart. One of the rules of comics it seems. No one can be happy. 

I hope we see more of them!

Onward.
