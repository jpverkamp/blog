> We become Grimnoir in order to become heroes, to sacrifice our lives in the pursuit of a higher cause, to defend the defenseless . . . Iâ€™ve found that means attending a lot of funerals.

{{< goodreads book="Hard Magic" >}} was a magical detective / spy story. It was a lot of fun, but there were only a few hints of the bigger story behind the story.  

<!--more-->

In {{< goodreads book="Spellbound" >}}, things took a turn for the powerful as we learned more about what the Power was and just how crazy a Spellbound could be.  

{{< goodreads book="Warbound" >}} ramps it up another level, with the rise of a false Chairman, and the Enemy's Pathfinder bringing war to Actives all over the Earth. It's a well deserved and well written conclusion to the story.  

The worldbuilding is just as interesting as it ever was, especially now that we see a lot more about how the Power and its magic actually work-- particularly as we see how the rules we thought we knew can be bent and broken.  

The characters are great as well. The relationship/counterpoint between ex(ish) Iron Guard Toru Tokugawa and Jake Sullivan is pretty great, especially their final confrontation in the epilogue. Faye is a wonderful, crazy girl with just the right combination of innocence, spunk, and flat out power. All of the other Grimnoir and pirates and Iron Guard? Great.  

About the worst I can say for the conclusion is it seems to end too quickly. I wish I could have spent just a little while longer in the world. Perhaps the short stories?  

Overall, one of the better series I've read in a long time. Give it a read.
