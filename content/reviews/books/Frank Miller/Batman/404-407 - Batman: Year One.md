A relaunch for a new age. Itâ€™s impressive how many Batman characters they manage to fit into a volume. Even if more than a few plots are left for later, itâ€™s still a solid launching point. 

Also, the cursive is hard to read at timesâ€¦

Thoughts as I read (spoilers):

## Chapter 1: Who I Am, How I Came to Be

An introduction to Gordon more than Batman so far.

Just how many familiar faces are we going to get?

Thereâ€™s the line!

## Chapter Two: War is Declared

A suspect! Or two. 

## Chapter Three: Black Dawn

Itâ€™s a Bat-Swarm!!

## Chapter Four: Friend in Need

Sneaky!

Makes you wonder. Does the existence of true story powered individuals make one like Batman more or less believable? 

Oh right, thatâ€™s the plot of Watchmen. ðŸ˜†

Heh. Itâ€™s funny because itâ€™s true.
