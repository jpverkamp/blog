Why yes. It is an odd time of year to be reading a Christmas Treasury. But *i* has been insisting on stories out of this book over and over again, so I figured I might as well write it down. It's a whole collection of the cute Christmas (or at least Winter) themed stories with the absolutely delightful illustrations that are Jan Brett's trademark.

The individual stories:

*The Mitten*: The one I've read the most. Absurd in the way only children's stories seem able to get away with. Best for younger readers. 

*The Wild Christmas Reindeer*: A more 'moral' story about listening to those you work with. Fun to have a 'different' list of Reindeer than I ever heard growing up with. 

*Trouble with Trolls*: Trolls keep trying to steal the dog; little girl keeps tricking them all the way up the mountain. Another cute story and great to see the little girl thinking her way out of trouble. 

*The Twelve Days of Christmas*: The song. The art is delightful though. 

The Hat: Perhaps too close a cousin to *The Mitten* (which I prefer). Cute enough though. 

*Christmas Trolls*: Starts with the same tricksters as in *Trouble With Trolls*, ends up with a much more wholesome lesson about the 'spirit of Christmas'. I enjoyed it. 

*The Night Before Christmas*: The same story, nothing particularly special about this one. The art is nice though.
