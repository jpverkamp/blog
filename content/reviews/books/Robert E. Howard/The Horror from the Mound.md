I recently read through a large part of Lovecraft's work. It was interesting seeing the first of what eventually became the Lovecraftian Mythos, but there were still some issues with it--Lovecraft wasn't really the best when it came to plot or character and was very much a product of his times.  

If The Horror from the Mound is any indication, Howard took the feel of the world that Lovecraft had build and really built on it. The Horror from the Mound takes something that we've heard of a thousand times before (the vampire) and takes it in another direction. Well worth the read.

If you'd like to listen to the story, Pseudopod had an excellent recording on their 11 Aug 2016 release: [Pseudopod 503: The Horror from the Mound](http://pseudopod.org/2016/08/11/pseudopod-503-the-horror-from-the- mound/).  

On top of that, he created Conan and Solomon Kane? I'm going to have to read some more of his works.
