> So that was what had happened before the survey. Now we’re here, ready for the next major disaster. (Spoiler warning.)

It's a full length Murderbot novel! Yay! And it gets far deeper and weirder into corners of the worldbuilding we've only had hints of before. I love seeing the hints of tension with the corporations and how much control they hvaqe, the weirdness that is alien remnants, and the knowledge that there are super weird problems out there that aren't necessarily directly related to Murderbot.

Plus the return of an old favorite in ART, the potential spread of what makes Murderbot Murderbot and all sorts of cases of Murderbot not quite fitting in--and that's okay.

All together, a great novel. I think I slightly prefer the shorter ones, but a mix works really well as well.
