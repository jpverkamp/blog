An odd book. It's supposed to be #6 in the series, but really, it's a prequel to {{<crosslink "Network Effect">}}. There's not much you need to know between the two, so you can read them in either order and if it were up to me, I'd probably swap them (mostly because I want to know what happens next!), but it still works.

Just like all the rest, the star of the show is Murderbot. 

> Or I could use the name Rin. I liked it, and there were some humans outside the Corporation Rim who thought it was actually my name. I could use it, and the humans on the Station wouldn’t have to think about what I was, a construct made of cloned human tissue, augments, anxiety, depression, and unfocused rage, a killing machine for whichever humans rented me, until I made a mistake and got my brain destroyed by my governor module.

I love the tone, dry humor, the barely (or not at all) suppressed existential angst. It's great. Someone that just doesn't understand and trying fit in to a human world is just such a fascinating read--and the fact that they *are okay with being different* is great. I love the character. 

> (Okay, so a human or augmented human might have made those same mistakes. Maybe exploring every possible outcome of each action in an inescapable loop of paranoia and anxiety wasn’t the most normal reaction-state but hey, if it was, there would be a lot fewer stupid murders. I don’t know what I’m trying to get at with this. I’d make a better corporate spy? Probably? Except not being a corporate spy left a lot more time for media so that was just never going to be an option.) (And also, I’d rather be disassembled while conscious, again.)

Plotwise, it's a solid closed room murder mystery turning action film and works on both fronts. I love seeing Murderbot being competent--and occasionally messing up still, like we all do. I love seeing the relationships with both the people we knew and a few more Preservationists. 

I think the only negative--is that I'm caught up now. I want more! 

Well worth the read.
