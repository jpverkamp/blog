> The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.

Reading {{< goodreads book="1984" >}} and Animal Farm back to back was ... probably not a great idea. They're entirely too similar. In one, the government already has power and in the other it's an (animal) government coming to power, but the tactics used are all together too similar.

Nevertheless, I would say that Animal Farm really does fit in that set of books where there's a point to it, more than just reading for the story, for better or for worse. The idea that the best of ideas can be corrupted, told through the eyes of various farmyard animals.  

If you're going to read this or 1984, I'd say read this. If you're going to read both, split them up a bit. :) But I'd say both are worth the read.
