> There is nothing like looking, if you want to find something. You certainly usually find something, if you look, but it is not always quite the something you were after.

I don't really need to review the Hobbit. It's a delightful book and you've probably already read it. If you haven't, you should. 

What I can do though is *highly* HIGHLY recommend listening to the audiobook narrated by Andy Serkis (the voice of Gollum in the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies). Oh, he's *good*. And not just as Gollum, but as everyone.
