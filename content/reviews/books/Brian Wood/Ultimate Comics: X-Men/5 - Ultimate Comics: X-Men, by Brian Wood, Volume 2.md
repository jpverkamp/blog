Utopia. 

Turns out, pretending the Sentient Seed died out lasted… not at all. Now there’s a new Mutant homeland in America…

That’s actually really cool. 

Of course Tian isn’t thrilled by the competition. It’s kind of amazing that after so long, Jean is still around. This has potential… but she’s starting with lies. I’m sure it will go well. Especially if she’s both hiding and going by her original name. Wat. 

Overall, it’s a neat story. If I didn’t know the Ultimate line was nearly over, I’d be intrigued.  So it goes. 

Onward!
