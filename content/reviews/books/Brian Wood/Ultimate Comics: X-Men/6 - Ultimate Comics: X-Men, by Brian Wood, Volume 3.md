Jean has never been the most stable personality, at last not in the Ultimate Universe. And… I get it. So much power, so young. And yet… she keeps causing more issues again and again. Oy. 

It all seems so sudden to escalate. And then in the way of comics—so suddenly over. 

Oh and apparently the Sentient Seed dies again? Not sure what the point of that was either way. 

So it goes. 

Onward.
