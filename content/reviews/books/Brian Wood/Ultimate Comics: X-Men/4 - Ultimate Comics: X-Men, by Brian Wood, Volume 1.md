So here we go again again (again?). Another Volume 1.

It could have been an interesting story. The Mutant Cure. The last 20 or so mutants (in the US/public). Divisions even among them. A Mutant Seed that can cure world hunger. 

But it’s all moving so fast I barely even have a chance to get to know anyone we didn’t already know. And those left feel different. 

If this has been the start of Ultimate X-Men, opening with Ultimatum? That would have been cool. As it is? Meh. 

Almost to the end. Onward!

Where do you even go from a story like that?

Handy. Mildly terrifying. 

And so very temporary.
