It's a book about spoons. 

And witches, of course. 

> “Well, I know there are Wiccans, right? Like a religion?” No one gave her any indication she was on the right path, so she kept talking. “And there are Halloween witches—like vampires and demons and all that. And I know about the bullshit witch trials. Thousands of women burned at the stake for being smart or queer or loud. I guess that’s about it.”

But really about spoons.

It's not really an urban fantasy / magic hiding in our world sort of story. There's magic, but it takes a while and even then it's rare and subtle. Which could very well be exactly what you're looking for. But I was hoping for something a bit more. 

On the other hand, I really did enjoy the dynamic between Lucky and Stella. Seeing a granddaughter taking care of her grandmother who's getting on in years while they both go on one big adventure isn't the story I often get into. 

Villain/plotwise... I actually could have done without. What we get is entirely overblown and underdone at the same time, if that makes any sort of sense. He felt a caricature of a villain but we all knew they'd beat him in the end, for no real cost.

Honestly, it could have been the witches versus the world, with smaller stakes throughout and I think I would have liked it all the more. 

Overall, it's fine. You might even like it far more than I did, especially knowing what you're in for. Onward!
