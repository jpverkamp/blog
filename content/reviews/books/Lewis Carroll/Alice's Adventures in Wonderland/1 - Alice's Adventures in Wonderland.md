> How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to another.

Well that's a weird book. 

I'm sure I've read it before and I know I've at least seen the Disney version, but apparently I haven't reviewed it, so here we go. 

That's a weird book. 

Good though.

In a slightly more verbose nutshell, it's the story of Alice falling down a rabbit hole into a weird world wherein she constantly changes size (for reasons), talks to various animals and other strange characters, and generally finds herself confused. 

> Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.

The entire time reading it is somewhat surreal. From chapter to chapter, what happens barely matters, but all the long, you're trying to figure out what weirdness could possibly happen next. 

> Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that's the great puzzle!

Probably worth a read? At least for the historical context of just what this story is?
