And so it ends... (for now?)  

A crazy series and another crazy story. Or I guess multiple stories all tied together. It's got a neat enough premise:  

<!--more-->

* Super-powered individuals exist, both heroes and villians (and a whole pile in between)   * Super-villians cannot be easily contained in normal prisons, so a new prison must be made for them (the titural Hotel Oblivion)   * They escape (because of course they do)  

Chaos ensuses.  

It doesn't quite hold together as well as the first two stories, but the sheer graphical inanity is worth reading. I should really watch the show at some point soon.

Off to Afterspace! (Who knows?!)

Riding a giant rooster! With quite the language too.

Heh. It's funny because umbrella (and even funnier when you explain the joke).  

And that's all for now, although volume 4 is planned for this year apparently. With COVID-19... who knows. But sometime!
