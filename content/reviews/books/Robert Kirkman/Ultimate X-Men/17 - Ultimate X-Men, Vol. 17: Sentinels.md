Bishop, stuck in the past. A whole new band of X-Men. Sentinels. Fenris Twins. Betrayal. 

Time travel gets weird, yo. 

No one ever stays dead in comics. Except Bucky, Jason Todd, and Uncle Ben. And even two of those eventually came back…

Onward to the **real** big bad.

Oh my. That’s an interesting choice.

Along all the ridiculously ‘minimal’ outfits the X-Men end up in… that’s certainly one of them.
