Time travel. It always seems to come back--have come back? will come back? will have come backend? --to that in the end. 

In this case, Xavier did… something to bring Ultimate Cable back to stop him. And who is Cable? Well that’s the question, isn’t it? 

An interesting story, with quite the stakes. 

Going to have to see where it goes from here!

Wait. Cable is who?

That’s a fun twist.

That’s… less fun. I did not care for this Xavier before. This is not better.

… that’s an entry. And deserved really.

So. Real? Trick? Bootstrap paradox?

Don’t think they’ve ever been mentioned. Makes sense.

He’s… got a point.
