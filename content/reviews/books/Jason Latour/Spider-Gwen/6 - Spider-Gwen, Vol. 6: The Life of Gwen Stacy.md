Gwens.

Looking for help.

And all for a secret (even to the Watchers…) cabal of Gwens. 

Man comics sometimes. This is a hit more cosmic than I want right now. 

And the next issue is… Spider-Geddon. I’ll come back to it. 

The last with her father though was cute. Just a lot for a single issue. 

Side note: the art dramatically shifted halfway through #33. Always jarring, that.
