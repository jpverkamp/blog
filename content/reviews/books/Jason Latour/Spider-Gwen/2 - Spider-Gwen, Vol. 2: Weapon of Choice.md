And... after [[Spider-Women]](), we're back!

Two (ish) volumes in and we already have the crisis of faith/lost powers one. Whee!

With Kraven no less. Such an odd villain. 

Time running out for Gwen, Castle on her tail—and on the edge it seems—and Captain Stacy has a solution. Luckily, Gwen made friends with… Reed Richards?

Intense. Curious how long this lasts.

Man, poor Gwen. Even if for better and for worse he has a point. 

And of course to top it all off?

Huh. Alt Reed Richards. That's neat.

That's kind of funny. Spider-ADHD? Maybe I should read that series next.
