Okay, after [[Spider-Man/Spider-Gwen: Sitting in a Tree|Sitting in a Tree]](), back to our regularly scheduled Spider-Gwen!

lol. 

And then of course, as these things do everything escalated. Harry/Lizard. Venom. Mr. Murderhands. 

All the chaos!

The main Spider-Gwen storyline was getting a bit weak there, but I'm glad to see this as a return to form. I'm really curious what happens next here. 

Onward!
