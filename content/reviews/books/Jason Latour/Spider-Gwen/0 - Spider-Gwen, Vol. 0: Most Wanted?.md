title: 'Spider-Gwen, Vol. 0: Most Wanted?'
---
It’s been a minute. Let’s read some Spider-Gwen. A Reddit post has a [reading order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpiderGwen/s/F0Ml2g31iH). Man comics are complicated. 

So here we have Spider-Gwen. An alternate Spider Gwen Stacy! Her dad’s a cop (hunting her) and life is complicated.

We have a small pile of villains—mostly a Vulture, but also Kingpin, Frank Castle, and Matt Murdoch. Ambiguous at both. I’m curious where it goes from here!

A bit of a chaotic start, but I’m looking forward to it!

As I reads, **spoilers**!

I feel kind of dropped into the middle of things here. 

And this is even the “volume 0!”

Huh, okay. Different universe? Spider-Man does that. Is Kingpin still a mob boss? Is Daredevil still good? Or even Daredevil?!

I suppose we’ll find out!

Looks like we’re skipping the very first part and to the Captain Stacy reveal!

Okay so she starts in Spider-Verse. I’ll probably go back and read that eventually!

And Frank Castle!

The Spider-Verse is delightfully wacky.

So weird. Especially as it lasts. So… psychotic break and / or brain damage?

Literally the next panel. 

And then, at the end of the last issue of the volume…

Oh my.
