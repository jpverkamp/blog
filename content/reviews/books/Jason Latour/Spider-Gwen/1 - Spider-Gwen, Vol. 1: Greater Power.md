When worlds collide…

![](/embeds/books/attachments/spider-gwen-2015-v1-textbundle-eeebab.jpeg)

In this universe, Peter Parker wanted to be a hero and got killed for it. So… why is the Lizard apparently still running around?

Also, the Green Goblin!

So much in this world built around a the severe ‘not what it looks like’ of Peter’s death. Strains incredulity… but that’s comics. And it (so far) is working for me. 

The introduction of this world’s Captain America was fun. I appreciate the quick backstory. 

Likewise Harry Osborne. Dungeons and Dragons nerds unite!

I’m enjoying this series. 

Onward!

As-reading thoughts: (**spoilers**)

… lol. 

Also who is this Captain America?

(We then get a backstory interlude for her starring on the next page…)

Samantha “Sam” Wilson.

So many [[Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse|Across the Spider-Verse]]() references/inspirations!

I have no idea where this pregnant Spider-Jessica actually came from. I mean, the only basis I have is the [[Ultimate Spider-Man, Volume 17: Clone Saga|Ultimate Spider-Man version]](). Which… was an interesting one to be sure.

Delightfully twisty multiversal world building GO!

Oh that’s quite the realization… for a lifelong cop especially. Interesting to see what’s next for him.
