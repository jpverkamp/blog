> We live and breathe words. .... It was books that made me feel that perhaps I was not completely alone. They could be honest with me, and I with them.

I'm not 100% sure why I finished this book. But I suppose that having finished it at all might just be a testament to ... something?  

<!--more-->

It's pretty much a YA paranormal romance / steampunk (vaguely) to a T. There's a (ridiculous) love triangle, a bit of fighting and flirting (could do with more of the former), and now, this time only POLITICS!  

I think the reason that it's hard to describe this book is ... nothing much happens. There's a bit about the Shadowhunters trying to kick everyone out of their institute (why is someone so young in charge anyways?). There's about one scene with the automatons (like I said, barely clockworks). And there's the love triangle (a huge part of the story, that; blech). Especially when you have quotes like this:  

> You see it, don't you, James? Without Tessa there is nothing for me--no joy, no light, no life. If you loved me, you would let me have her. You can't love her as I do. No one could. If you are truly my brother, you would do this for me.

Sudden love interest to make the triangle is sudden.  

I think the worst thing about these books (and perhaps why I'm not at all the target audience) is how teenager everyone is. There's angst over an  {{< spoiler >}}obviously fake curse{{< /spoiler >}}  , angst over the love triangle, a  {{< spoiler >}}marriage proposal between teenagers{{< /spoiler >}}  . It's just. Oy?  

For some reason, I think I'm actually going to finish the series. Wish me luck?
