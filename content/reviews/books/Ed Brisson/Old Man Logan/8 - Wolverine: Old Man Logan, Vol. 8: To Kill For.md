First half: Kingpin has gone all respectable! On the surface. Again. 

It’s impressive that keeps working. 

Bullseye is a weird character. Logan’s eye is not healing. And that’s about it

Second half: An Old Geezer and some Z-list X-Men defend the school from… dating site scams? 

Cute. But also nothing special.

… when did the mutants end up in Central Park. That’s a neat trick.
