The hand! Samurai! Resurrection!

That’s a hot mess of a story—although some of that is probably not really having the background for who a lot of these people are. So it goes. 

It was nice actually (sort of) seeing Logan deal with the slower healing factor. I feel like though most of this we’ve heard of it, but no real problems. 

Fun enough read. Onward!
