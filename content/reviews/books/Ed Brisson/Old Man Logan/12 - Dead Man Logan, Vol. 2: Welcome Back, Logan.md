And so it ends as it began. Logan and a Hulk, in the Wastelands.

The best part? Saberteeth. So many Sabertooths. Sabertoothipode?

The weirdest part? Suddenly Mjolnir?

I’ll admit… Thor’s speech patterns (and font) coming with the hammer is pretty funny.

I really feel like I missed something. Been a weird series for a while. 

And now it ends. Where to next?
