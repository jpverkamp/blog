The hand returns…

No, not that Hand. Logan’s hand. The one with the adamantium claws. I’ve actually enjoyed seeing him with the mismatched claws for a few volumes now.

Bit of a bummer, other than that. More spinning wheels with nowhere to go for Old Man Logan.

Part one: Kraven hunting Logan? It’s a Kraven / Savage Land storyline. Vaguely interesting at best. So it goes. 

Part two: continuation of the Bullseye feud from the last volume. He’s nuts … and not all that interesting. 

Anyways. Onward.

And that’s how you get a name.
