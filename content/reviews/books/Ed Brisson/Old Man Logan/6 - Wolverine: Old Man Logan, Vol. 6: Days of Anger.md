Hulks! Maestro!

![](/embeds/books/attachments/old-man-logan-6-textbundle-6dc07a.png)

Apparently in all the wacky parallel universe shenanigans, Maestro “rescued” a bunch of Hulks and brought them back to this world. 

Knowing basically nothing about how Maestro came to be or what all these Hulks can actually do, it’s a strange story.

Not to mention… Maestro’s plan is kind of bad. 

Still, it’s an interesting enough for, a connection to Logan’s future/past, and it’s something we might see more of!
