title: Yumi and the Nightmare Painter
---
Oh Sanderson. How *do* you do it. 

Three of the four novels in the "Year of Sanderson". Tress was amazing and if anything... Yumi is even better. (Frugal Wizard was fine. :smile:)

<!--more-->

The asthetic is amazing. Two worlds, one full of serenity. Floating plants. Natural hot springs. Meditation. And ... stacking rocks?

> Each yoki-hijo trained in an ancient and powerful art. A deliberate, wondrous artistry requiring the full synergy of body and mind. Geological reorganization on the microscale, requiring acute understanding of gravitational equilibrium.
> 
> In other words, they stacked rocks.

In the other, we have a city surrounded by a perpetual nightmare monster spawning blackness, lit by constant glowing neon lights. It's cyberpunk... without the cyber parts? 

On top of that, a body swapping sort of story. Yumi (of the first world) and Painter (of the second) have to learn to live in each other's very different lives. 

On *top of that*, Hoid doing his narrator thing again!

> (She was, of course, dead wrong. Remember what the poet said: “Never let something trivial, like a sense of humor, get in the way of a good joke.”  
> The poet was me.  
> He said it right now.)  

On **top of that** we get a *solid* (although *probably* not overwhelming) chunk of Cosmere goodness. Not just Hoid this time, but also Design, Sleepless, Cognitive Shadows, and SPACESHIPS. I expect that weakens Yumi a bit as an entry point, but honestly, I've read too much to know. And from my point of view, I love it. 

> (He was right. If you’ve been wondering how they work, this is a big clue. Plants on Yumi’s world don’t really defy physics so much as they sneak past while physics is distracted by a nice drama on the viewer. Probably something involving pendulums. Physics loves those things.)

And that's not even mentioning the absolutely bonkers conclusion. I had some inklings (heh) about where the story might go... but I didn't guess the half of it. Crazy yet somehow *real* worldbuilding yet again. 

Oh it's a good book. If you've read and enjoyed much else of Sanderson's work, *read this one*. If you've not... give it a try? I'm curious how the Cosmere stuff works for you. :smile:

Onward and soon to Secret Project #4!
