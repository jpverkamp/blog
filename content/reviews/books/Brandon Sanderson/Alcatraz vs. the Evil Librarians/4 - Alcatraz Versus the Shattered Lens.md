> Impossible things are really rough to do, you know.

And man, Alcatraz does all manner of impossible things this time around. There's wacky tech (like Teddy bear grenades and giant flying bats (not made of glass)), wacky situations (Alcatraz getting a major (temporary) promotion (of sorts)), and powers (a Talent for Being Bad at Math). Pretty much exactly what you'd expect. 

And all along, we're getting more about the world building, one thing that I always enjoy in Sanderson's books. There definitely seems to be a connection between it all--but exactly how it all works together and how that can make things go wrong... well, that's the story, isn't it?

Alcatraz continues to fall for Bastille.

> She was absolutely beautiful. She had long blonde hair, kind of the shade of a bowl of mac and cheese. She was smiling a wide, genuine smile—which was rather the shape of a macaroni and cheese noodle. She seemed to radiate light, much like a bowl of mac and cheese might if you stuffed a lightbulb into it. Her skin was soft and squishy, like— Okay. Maybe I’m too hungry to be writing right now.

In a very Alcatraz sort of way. 

It's a fun book and quite an ending. Of all the things to Break... Here we go, one more book from Alcatraz's perspective / in the original series. We'll have to see where it can possible go from here!
