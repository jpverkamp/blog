> Some of you have been waiting for years to read this, the final volume of my autobiography.

I cannot really imagine that being the last book. Or at least the last one that would be published for another 6 years! Now, in hindsight, it's obvious (and my kids' totally already knew), but man. That's NOT AN ENDING. 

> “Fine,” Grandpa said. “You fetch your evil Librarian mother from the jail. I’ll go warm up the giant penguin!” 

Ahem. 

> “Well, that was fun,” Grandpa said as he climbed to his feet. “Anyone dead?”  
> “Does my pride count?” Draulin asked, dusting herself off.  
> “I don’t think so,” Grandpa said. “I killed that years ago. Dif, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but shoving my grandson out of planes is usually my job. So next time, kindly refrain until I give the word.”  
> “Sorry, sir,” Dif said, looking abashed.”   

The Dark Talent sees Alcatraz. Sans Dark Talent, off on a mission to save the world ... and to save the girl. Just don't let Bastille hear you say that. 

It's a lot like the rest of the series. New Smedrys (oh Dif), new worldbuilding (the HIBRARY! Beneath Washington DC!), new schenanigans (that is *quite* a library; also, rocket powered penguins), and a big new battle at the end (leading up to that oft forementioned SACRIFICE UPON AN ALTAR OF ENCYCLOPEDIAS). 

But it's not the ending. And the ending can more than tell you that, which... is honestly getting kind of old. 

It's doubly painful since not only did it end quickly, but it also ended painfully. In a series where guns put people in comas and main characters have magic powers seemingly purposely designed (hmm) to get them out of trouble... well, it's a bit of a shock. 

It's still a lot of fun and I'm looking forward to where in the *world* the series will *actually* end... For real this time? Onward!
