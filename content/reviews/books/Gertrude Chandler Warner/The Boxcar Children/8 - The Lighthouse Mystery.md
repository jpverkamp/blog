> Renting a lighthouse is unusual, but even more so is an unfriendly boy's peculiar behavior.

You know what's even more unusual? Traveling home from {{< goodreads book="The Woodshed Mystery" >}}, seeing a lighthouse for sale on the side of the road and _deciding that your grandfather should **buy it**_. And knowing that he totally could[^wat].  

<!--more-->

Luckily (?), it's already been sold, so instead they just rent it. And of course find a mystery in the night which even to my five year old wasn't that much of a surprise. But it's still an engaging story and a new settings, so that's cool. And the idea of using concrete and rocks to make natural beach chairs is one I may have to steal (albeit sadly without the beach)[^environment].  

They also sort of force themselves into the grumpy family, whether they want it or not. But it all ends up well in the end because _friendship_.  

And hey. It has a lighthouse!

It's a fun enough story, par for the course for the Boxcar Children. My children enjoyed it at least.  

[^wat]: It's even crazier when later Jessie complains because "four new [swimsuits] would cost too much". Um. More or less than a _lighthouse_...  

[^environment]: Granted, it's not the most environmentally friendly option. Everything in moderation?
