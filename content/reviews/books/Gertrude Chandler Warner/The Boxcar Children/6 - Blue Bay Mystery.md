Vacation this summer? Let's get purposely stranded on a tropical island!  

There's actually a lot more of the feel of the first book to this one, since they're on the island for a few weeks without any way of getting more supplies other than what they can build and find themselves. They do have two adults along though: Grandfather and newcomer Lars Larson[^madeup]--who previously got shipwrecked here ... and apparently wants to go back for vacation now? Sure. And Mike again, who's fun enough. Do any of the other children have friends to spoil with vacations from a rich grandfather?

In any case, it's a fun enough story in an exotic locale, perfect for escapism and learning how to live off the land in a relatively safe manner. There's a mystery, but not much of a mystery and everything ends up happy at the end. Pretty much a Boxcar Children story in a nutshell.  

[^madeup]: Totally sounds made up. Except apparently there's a [conservative radio talk show host](https://www.larslarson.com/) by that name.
