That was cute.  

Taking a train ride across the country is on my list of things to try one day and in a caboose would be even more interesting.  

<!--more-->

One of the best in a while.  

A few random thoughts:  

> Grandfather began, "You see I have a friend who owns a railroad."

Come on. It doesn't all have to be about how crazy much money and power you have...  

> "Don't be late, either," Grandfather called again. "The train won't wait for you, you know."

Of **course** he's going to miss the train now. It's insane to me that they didn't just check no matter how much he said he'd nap.  

> Mr. Alden looked at the sign. "Oh, I know all about that store," he said. "It is famous. We can trust them to tell us the truth."

That just feels weird.
