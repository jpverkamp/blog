Music laced with spells turns anyone who has plastic surgery ugly. Not even kidding. Also zombies, but apparently they’re not actually dead (killing of like half of LA is apparently too much). So … just ugly. 

It’s… fine? 

I didn’t even take any pretty pictures. 

If we weren’t down to one more volume and a new writer…
