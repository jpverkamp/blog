That is one heck of a story. In a nutshell: decades ago, there was a woman named Henrietta Lacks who developed cancer. While treating her, a doctor took a sample of her cells, which turned out to be rather unusual. Unlike any other cells found before (or since?), they never died. They just kept growing and dividing and living forever.

This was huge for basically the entire field of biology/medicine/etc and should (in a better world) have been huge for her family and legacy. Instead, the world forgot her name and her family got basically nothing.

[[The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks]]() is the story of Henrietta Lacks, her immortal cells, her family, and the reporter with the awesome name trying to track the whole story down.  

That core of the book is fascinating and wonderful. Science really is more complicated and goes far deeper than I ever expect and the story of how it all fits together gets all sorts of complicated. But for better or for worse, the book doesn't just cover the science and history, but also has the human element. And the people in this story are exemplars of how race and poverty and history manage to ruin just about everything. Man the world is screwed up; and it makes for a hard to read story.

Overall, a hard read, but well worth it.
