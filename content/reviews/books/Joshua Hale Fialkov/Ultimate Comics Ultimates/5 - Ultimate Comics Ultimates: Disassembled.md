Who would be the absolute worst person in the Ultimate Universe to get the Infinity Stones?

Worse than that. 

Now… both at once. 

It’s a pretty crazy volume with some interesting twists and some big action pieces. 

But really, it’s just the beginning of the end. Cataclysm is coming. 

Onward!

Notes. Spoilers.

Awesome. 

I mean. Terrible. This Hulk isn’t even close to being a Hero. He just straight up are people in his introductory story line. 

But a dark Hulk with the stones v got potential. 

And then to turn it up another notch?

Reed also makes a better villain I think.

Huh. That’s an interesting point. 

How do you define life to include what he’s become?

That’s a neat trick. Poor Stark. And Anthony. Whatever he was/is.

And now Stark is only the armor. That’s actually a fascinating concept. We’ll see how long it sticks.
