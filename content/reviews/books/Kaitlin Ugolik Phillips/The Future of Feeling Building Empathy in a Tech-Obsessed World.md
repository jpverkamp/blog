Did not finish at about 50%. I mostly picked this up from the Amazon Prime selection.  

There are some good points in there, that we could use more empathy in the world and that it’s hard to find in an increasingly digital world. But those good points get repeated over and over far more than I cared to read about them.  

<!--more-->

There’s an interesting section about VR (which I look forward to and agree it may just help with the empathy thing), but again far too long.  

And finally, I’m not sure what the author’s credentials are to speak on the subject. They might just be an expert in the field, but it doesn’t really come across that way. Most of the examples given are anecdotal or studies that feel ‘weak’ to me. So it goes.  

Perhaps I need more empathy for the author. It’s hard to put yourself out there with a book like this, especially in the non-fiction space.
