No one expects the Spanish Inquisition... or a German expedition to the North Pole? Also, if that werenâ€™t enough, we have Basque independence and frankenfish! 

It's formulaic as any of these are and the inciting historical events are at once a bit weird--and not nearly as earth shattering as they often are? This time around, the modern threat is perhaps a bigger one. 

There's really not much more to say about these at this point. If you've liked the first three (or the whole of [[Dirk Pitt]]()), you'll probably enjoy this one! If not... how did you get here? 

A weird one to end the year on, but I enjoyed it well enough. 

Onward!
