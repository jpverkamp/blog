Swallowed by a sperm whale.

That's quite the introductory seen. Starts with whaling, full on [[todo:Moby Dick]]() (I should read that at some point). It's an interesting story, with just enough weird science to see where it's going in the 'present day'. 

A Corona Virus. 

This... felt all the more real in this post Covid world. And a sign of how it could have been so much worse--if only we didn't have weird ocean life and a super well funded, run, and liked NUMA to save the world. :smile:

A Hermaphrodite third triplet as a big bad. 

That's... just lazy. The Chinese Triad / mafia stuff, pretty cool. This reveal? Meh. 

So, at this point? It's Clive Cussler. The books are enjoyable enough, but I want to listen to something else for a while. So I'm moving on to something else. Perhaps one day I'll return. 

Onward!
