And so it ends. I think I enjoyed the book more and rated it more highly knowing it was the last of the series, although I guess Dirk Cussler could easily continue it, given that he's been the co-author on these books for years now. But for now, it's over and it's time for me to move on to other books.  

Plotwise, there are a lot of threads that feel familiar, but there are only so many different ancient civilizations you can dig up treasures for--and I'm pretty sure Cussler hit them all. This time around, an ancient Egyptian princess apparently made it to Celtic Ireland somehow. A mummy is stolen, bioengineered bacteria try to take over the world, someone is taking militant feminism to an extreme, and wacky (destructive) highjinks ensue.

It's Dirk Pitt in a nutshell and it's not a bad book at all for what it is. A good end.
