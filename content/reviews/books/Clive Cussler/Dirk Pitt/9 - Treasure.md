How do you connect a plane crash based on two overlapping terrorist plots, hidden mob-like family, a Mexican revolution based on bringing back the might of the Aztec empire, an Egyptian revolution based on fundamental Islam, a Roman ship far from where any Roman ship has any right to be, and the lost Library of Alexandria?  

Carefully. Very very carefully.

Or you can read {{< goodreads book="Treasure" >}} and find out. As you might guess, it's an absolutely ridiculous book, but at this point, that's pretty much Clive Cussler/Dirk Pitt in a nutshell. Don't read it expecting to make overly much sense. Read it because it's a rollicking adventure novel with a sprinkling of archaeology.  

I think the biggest negative of the book is that there are really two plotlines--the treasure and the revolutions--and they only barely interact with each other. It's not a deal breaker, but it is unfortunate.  

A fun listen though, still worth it.
