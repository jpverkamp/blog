Man of action Permutter saves the day!  

Wait. What?  

<!--more-->

I don't know.  

It's another 'lost treaty found just in time' mixed with another 'lost nuclear bomb' story with a stunning 'retired warship back for one last hurrah' moment. Which is a crazy sentence in any other context, but it sort of works?  

Overall, I really don't have much else to say. It's Dirk Pitt. And at this point, it's almostover.
