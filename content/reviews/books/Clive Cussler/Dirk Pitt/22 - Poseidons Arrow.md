Well. I listened to it. It had something to do with a big conspiracy to control rare earth metals and a lost submarine. ... That's really about all that stuck in my head.  

It's got a lot of solid crazy action: in particular there's a battle in the Panama Canal, which is pretty awesome. But I'm really getting burnt out on this series. But I'm so close to finishing it... I think I'll still go for it, but I'm looking forward to it less than I had.
