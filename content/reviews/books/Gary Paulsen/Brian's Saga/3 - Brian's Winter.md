title: Brian's Winter
---
> Fall came on with a softness, so that Brian didn’t realize what was in store—a hard-spined north woods winter—until it was nearly too late.He had never thought he would be here this long. After the plane crash that marooned him in the wilderness he had lived day by day for fifty-four days, until he had found the survival pack in the plane. Then another thirty-five days through the northern summer, somehow living the same day-to-day pattern he had started just after the crash.

So basically, 'what if Brian' *wasn't* rescued at the end of [[Hatchet]]() (and thus [[The River]]() also doesn't happen). He still gets the survival pack from the plane, but no radio for help. 

And it goes... about as you'd expect? It's very cold, but he figures out skins and furs. He does improve on his hunting supplies and learns more nature stuff? 

Really, it's more of the same, which honestly is okay. I liked it more than [[The River]]().
