> Patience, he thought. So much of this was patience - waiting, and thinking and doing things right. So much of all this, so much of all living was patience and thinking.

This is a book about patience. 

> He had to keep thinking of them because if he forgot them and did not think of them they might forget about him. And he had to keep hoping.

And hope. 

And hunger.

And fire. 

And survival. 

It's a quick read--and it's probably been 20 years since I last read it, so I figured I would give it another chance. 

It's not a bad book. It feels visceral at times, really making you aware of Brian. And knowing that--because it's that sort of book--he has to survive at the end, you always have hope. Even if some of those situations are *so ridiculous*. 

Worth a read. 

And now, apparently, there are *4* sequels? How in the world are they going to do that? 

Onward!
