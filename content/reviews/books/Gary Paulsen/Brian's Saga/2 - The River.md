And so it went!

That's pretty much the idea. Brian is adjusting well enough, but still dreams of the wilderness. And now he has a chance to go back, so of course he does!

This time, with another along (ish), knives instead of a hatchet, and to a different lake. 

Of course, things have to go wrong... And this time Brian finds himself needing to make a raft and go down the titular River to get help. 

It's an interesting enough story, but I feel like there wasn't quite as much there are in [[Hatchet]]()? I'm curious what the rest have in store.
