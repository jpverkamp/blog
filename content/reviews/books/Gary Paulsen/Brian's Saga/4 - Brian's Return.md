title: Brian's Return
---
> Brian sat quietly, taken by a peace he had not known for a long time, and let the canoe drift forward along the lily pads. To his right was the shoreline of a small lake he had flown into an hour earlier. Around him was the lake itself, an almost circular body of water of approximately eighty acres surrounded by northern forest--pine, spruce, popular, and birch--and thick brush.

Brian is back. 

Again. 

After a couple years, Brian doesn't seem to be doing overly well adapting back to 'regular life'. So he ends up going back to the wilderness, this time at least with a few more supplies. It's another trip on a river (this time with a canoe) with a bunch more hunting and arrow building. 

Honestly, it ends before it really starts and I'm not entirely sure what the point of this one is compared to the two. We don't *really* get into Brian's headspace going back. So it goes. 

It is amusing that he takes Shakespeare with him this time around though. 

> Author's Note

> This is the final book about Brian, though someday I may do a nonfiction book about those parts of my life that were like Brian's.

*doubt*
