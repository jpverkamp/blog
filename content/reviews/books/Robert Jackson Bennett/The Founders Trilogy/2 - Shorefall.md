> Learn what your city has forgotten. What men of power have forgotten time and time again, throughout history—that there is always, always something mightier.

{{<crosslink Foundryside>}} was quite a ride, with an awesome magic system, great characters, and some nice not entirely too dark bits of revolution going on--and hints of something more. Shorefall takes all that... and turns it way the heck up to 11. 

<!--more-->

In a nutshell, take the magic system, add the deep 'old' magic, more powerful, but at a huge cost. Add a bigger bad, a thousand years in the making. And really up the stakes. It's not just about the people now, but rather about the whole city. About sanity. About the future. 

> There is no innovation that will ever spring from the minds of men that will not eventually be used for slaughter and control.

Man that's a crazy story. Much *much* darker than Foundryside, leaning much harder into the horror (especially body horror) sides of fantasy. If that's not your thing, perhaps treat Foundryside as a standalone. It works well enough that way. If it isn't a deal breaker though, Shorefall is an excellent escalation.
