> Franny, you are the genuine article. You are solid. You are certain. You are like a refrigerator. You hum.

Francine Poulet is the greatest Animal Control Officer in Gizzford County and now she has to go up against her own worst enemy: self doubt, panic attacks, and facing your fears. Also a ghost racoon. But that's not really what the story is about.

It's a lovely fun tale with a number of the characters we've come to know and love from the Deckawoo Drive universe and well worth the read aloud.
