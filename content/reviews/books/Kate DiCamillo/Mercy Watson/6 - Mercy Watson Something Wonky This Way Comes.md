After {{< goodreads book="Mercy Watson Goes for a Ride" >}}, I figured I should probably write about one of the shorter Mercy Watson stories that I really do like. {{< goodreads book="Mercy Watson: Something Wonky This Way Comes" >}} is that story.  

In a nutshell, the entire gang goes to a drive in movie, wherein Bottomless Buckets of popcorn, absolutely drenched in butter are served. Of course Mercy goes off to find the butter (as is often the plot) and chaos ensues. We get to see just about everyone, which is all sorts of fun trying to read aloud with a distinct voice per character (as I do) and in the end, all is well.

It's a cute story and a great introduction to this tier of lengths for these stories.
