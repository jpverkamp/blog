title: Pale Demon
---
So Rachel is sanctioned. She has one chance to travel (on purpose this time) to San Francisco to try to clear her name. Except... she can't fly, because politics--road trip! And has to take Trent, also because politics--road trip with Jenks, Ivy, Rachel, and Trent. 

What could possibly go wrong? 

> Jenks: Relax cookie maker. They’ve been there since Terre Haute. 

lol. [[wiki:Keebler elves]]()

Also [[wiki:Terre Haute]](). I went to school there. 

And then they blew up a national monument. 

And freed a demon. 

And saved another demon. 

And learned what is actually *different* about the female demons.[^trans]

[^trans]: Like you sometimes see in books where there are differences between men and women based on genetics, I wonder how that would interact with trans (in this case) demons? 

> But Al was shaking his head, looking ill. “I am not going to be the person who completes you,” he said, glancing at me and turning away. “You are one messed-up bitch.”

And suddenly... *baby*! (I'll leave you to guess if it's who you expect or not). 

Man that's a lot for a single book. And with what looks like might be permanent reprecussions across the Hollows universe (and Rachel especially) that we're only barely beginning to feel. 

Onward!

Side note: This was a fun line:

> “So all those buttons are different restaurants?” I asked, looking at the jukebox, now totally out of place, like a British police call box on the deck of the Titanic.

I understood that reference. :smile:

Second side note: So... how many cross breeds are possible in this universe? We have some hints because of how species diverged from one another. And we also have elves with some human lineage. But what else is possible? And what if we include all sorts of genetic tampering that is seemingly possible in this world...
