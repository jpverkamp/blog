title: Black Magic Sanction

So. Alcatraz is back in service. That's kind of brilliant. 

This time around, Rachel is dealing with her shunning--and far far worse. The witches of the world aren't on her side any more, but perhaps she can get some help from... Trent? Al? Nick?! (Why is Nick back around...)

And the only way out is... suddenly, we have a heist novel now. It seems like this is *really* not the time. And double that, when Rachel randomly decides to use that Pandora charm that's been floating around. *now?!*

Man she has issues with long term thinking.

And seems *so very* deadset on not killing anything ever. Which, I suppose if you're going to do black magic, you don't want to give anyone any other reasons to hate you. But sometimes, especially in a world like this, there are people you just can't hang on to. Oy. (Not to mention that she seems fine with those around her killing...) 

Especially after 8 books. And after what happened to Jenks[^jenks]. 

[^jenks]: So Rachel hadn't realized what Jenks did in [[Ley Line Drifter]]() about the side effects of embiggening. Fun that. I wonder what it will do for her? I was really wondering what Harrison would do about Pixies living so very short a time, but now... Well, Jenks won't die at least. {{<spoiler>}}The deaths we do get are intense though... :\{{</spoiler>}}

Overall, another good story. 

Onward!

Random world building notes:

> His eyes were alight. I'd seen that look on college students debating such ridiculous stuff as how the world would be today if Napoleon hadn't stirred that misaligned spell and won Waterloo, or if the Turn had never happened and we'd gone to the moon instead. "Okay, I got that," I said, and Pierce pushed from the table to take his plate to the sink.

I do love the subtle(ish) nods to our world / what might have been. Good times those.
