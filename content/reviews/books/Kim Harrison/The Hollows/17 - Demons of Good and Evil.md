title: Demons of Good and Evil
---
Well that's amusing. We went right from her birthday to his in just a few books. 

And now we have to deal with the fallout[^fallout] of not only Hodin but also that werewolf cursed idol from [[A Fistful of Charms|oh so long ago]](). And the return of that *other* demon born witch--Lee. Remember when Rachel sold him out to Al to save her own skin? And also (again) vampire politics and weres. And Trent's elf politics and daughters. And Al's part versus Hodin last book. 

Oh, what a complicated life they weave. 

[^fallout]: I feel like half or more of these books are 'dealing with the fallout'. But then, that's Rachel.

Overall, another solid adventure! And oh man does the fall out of this book hit hard for some reason. I do enjoy a book where you realize it's possible that some characters might die (even if *generally* not main characters (*cough* Kistin *cough*)), but oy does it hurt sometimes. 

One thought (since it's been on my mind): this is yet another book where 'never killing' versus Rachel's more 'creative' solutions comes up front and center. 

> “I’m sorry it came to this,” Cassie whispered, and the wolf’s remaining ear swiveled. There was intelligence in her gaze, but it was that of a wolf. {{<spoiler>}}Parker{{</spoiler>}} was no more.

That's... a touch even *more* permanent than Constance or Hodin, no? And those were bad enough. 

I'm curious if/when Rachel is going to actually cross that 'never killed' line. It feels like it's coming. 

It's crazy to think that (as of now), there's only one more. I don't even know what I'll be listening to next! Perhaps a few one offs, rather than entire 18 book series...

Onward!

A few semi-random thoughts I enjoyed:

> “Good for you,” I said, even as I wondered if the intelligent woman would ever land a job with her aura coated in Hodin’s smut and a two-slash demon mark on her wrist. *Not my fault, but still somehow my responsibility.*

I thought the (worse) problem was she had taken a third? 

Also, 'not my fault but still somehow my responsibility' is rather much Rachel.

> Lee flashed an uncomfortable red as Patricia stared at me. And where I usually might have done something to irritate her, like give her a vampiric kiss-kiss, this time, I only felt a growing dread. There were far too many high-end magic users in this tiny shop.

Another new kiss-kisss!

> “A spell utilizing a Möbius strip base creates a self-renewing magic. Back and forth like the tide. Never-ending and therefore dangerous.”

I feel like that might have come up before. Even if (in universe) the cost is... a lot. 

> “Rache, the furry blood bag don’t know anything,” Jenks said, and Constance gave him a pink-pawed one-finger salute.

Well that one isn't a kiss-kiss at least. 

> Trent frowned, clearly not wanting to argue in front of a dozen picnic tables full of people, and not with Ray on his hip. Me? I had no problem yelling in mixed company. I was a Midwest girl.

Oh hey, another Midwest girl yelling comment, just like in [[Trouble with the Cursed]](). It's interesting how these come up suddenly for a couple books then disappear again.
