> Making a spell is easy. It's trusting you did it right that's hard.

Another new (to me) urban fantasy in a 'the supernatural world has been made public' world? Yes please!

This time around, we have Rachel a witch and, as of the start of the story, bounty hunter. Frustrated with her job, she decides to quit. 

> I sighed. I hated the maze of bureaucracy with a passion, but I've found the best way to deal with it is to smile and act stupid. That way, no one gets confused.

And in this world, you just *don't do that*. So now she's gone from bounty hunter to having a price oh *her* head, backed only by her friend(ish) and former co-worker, living Vamp Ivy and Jenks[^spelling], a four-inch tall pixie. 

[^spelling]: I'm listening to this on audiobook. I totally expected that to be Jynx. 

If that wasn't enough, she's also stumbling into a super natural drug trade, a whole rat fighting ring (from impressively up close and personal), and summoned demons. 

Rachel is a lot of fun. Perfectly competent and willing to fight for it, even if things don't always go right. I enjoy Ivy, even if she's still mostly closed off through this book. Room to grow. And Jenks is hilarious. "You think my kids just popped out of the ground?" and all. 

The worldbuilding is a lot of fun. I always like trying to figure out what's diffrerent about this particular urban fntasty world and there is plenty of that here. Born vampires--*living* and only turning more traditional after death. Pixies and fairies, running their own smaller scale wars over garden space. Genetic engineering run amuck--leading to a perfectly reasonable fear of tomatoes. 

It's quite a a world. 

And it's fun to have the main character be a witch. I'm not entirely certain how much of a witch's magic is natural versus learned just yet, but mostly human magic user is always a fun point of view. 

So far I'm cautiously optimistic. I do love a good urban fantasy. It's a fun world (with openly acknowledged supernatural characters!) with fun characters and a lot of room to grow. And grow it did--with 18 out as of now[^goodreads]. 

Onward!

[^goodreads]: I'm amused the [goodreads series page](https://www.goodreads.com/series/40628-the-hollows) says "The series is expected to end with the 12th or 13th book". Not updated for a ... decade or more (book 12 came out in 2024), eh?
