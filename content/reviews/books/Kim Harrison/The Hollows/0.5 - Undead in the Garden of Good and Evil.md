> Life was more than waiting for it to end so she could started living. 

Man Ivy is a mess.

So this is the/a story of how Ivy came to be, how screwy (heh) vampires can be, how she got to be working as a runner, and how she came to meet Rachel. 

That's a pretty fun way to set it up. 

Oh, and much like [The Bridges of Eden Park]({{<ref "0 - Into the Woods.md">}}#the-bridges-of-eden-park) this (especially the Kisten parts) back to back with [[For a Few Demons More]]() is certainly a touch of whiplash.
