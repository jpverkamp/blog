Now that that is out of the way :smile:

Into the Woods is a collection of Hollows Shorts. Since I've liked the series enough to go ahead and want todo everything about it, I decided to pick up all the shorts. 

Because I track my reading, I have to draw the line somewhere, so here it is: all of the short stories will be collected here (updating as I read them). Novellas (and novelettes?) will get their own posts.

## Dirty Magic 

So. Banshees. I don't think they've been mentioned in the main series, and now we have a straight up banshee character! 

And oh, she's quite the character. 

Basically, they're uber-vamps, specifically feeding on emotions. With the ability to create 'banshee tears', which can store psychic energy for later? It's an interesting one.

Plus the first born banshee in a very long time? That's interesting. 

I wonder how long it will be (if ever) before we see either this banshee (or another) on screen?

Oh, and this one (for how short it is) is *spicy*. Which, I suppose, banshees. 

Onward!

## The Bridges of Eden Park

Well. After just recently finishing [[For a Few Demons More]](), this was a bit of a bunch in the teeth. We get Rachel and Kisten, out doing their thing, working together, saving Kisten's nephew (apparently). 

> Audric squinted in the sun up at me, then Kisten. “Are you and Ms. Rachel going to get married?” he asked from nowhere.

Oh children. 

> I opened my mouth to answer—it was a disturbing question for anyone but a vampire child—but Kisten beat me to it. “Only my heart, Audric,” he said. “Ms. Rachel is like the sun. See her sparkling there with the wind in her hair and fire in her eyes? You can’t catch the sun. You can only feel its touch on your face. And if you get too much of it, it burns you.”

Oh Kisten. 

It's a cute story, but oy that timing.
