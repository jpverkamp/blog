**Minor spoilers, mostly for the romance bits of the series**

So this is the book.

After a decade (for people reading along as the series came out) / six months (for me), {{<spoiler>}}they're finally together{{</spoiler>}}. 

> “Yeah, the elf looks good in the sun,” Jenks smart-mouthed, the pixy currently sitting on the bottom of my hooped earrings and out of the moderate wind. “When you going to put us all out of your misery and boink him?”

Given how it all started, you could totally expe4ct it coming... and I'm actually really rooting for them. I think they've both become better people through the books. Rachel is at least marginally less terrible at rushing into things and Trent is not outright murdering people quite so often. #goals

And it does lead to all sorts of fun politics. See, she's a demon and he's an elf. And the demons and elves **hate** one another. Something something, thousands of years of war and slavery. So of course this is going to come with all sorts of drama.

> Red finally gave up trying to bolt, and Trent settled into the saddle. The last couple of months with Trent had been… interesting. With Ellasbeth threatening to stay, I was seeing things in the light of “last time” and I was shocked to realize I didn’t like it, especially not with Landon’s threat. If not for the different tax bracket thing, or that he was going to be engaged, or that because of me, he’d lose everything if he didn’t marry Ellasbeth…

And that's just the romance part...

On top of *that* we have magic going amuck, going quite a bit deeper into how elf magic works--and just what/if their 'goddess' actually is. 

> “Duh. You think I’m going to trash anything Newt gives me? The woman is crazy, not stupid.”

Rachel of course has to save the day, but it's going to be a bit of a mess to get there. Rachel is really leveling up. It's not quite a 'chosen one' plot, but given how unique she is in this entire world, it's a near cousin of it. I'm not sure what to think about that. 

But storywise, it's quite an action packed adventure. Romancewise--like I said--I'm looking forward to seeing how this all shakes out. 

> Etude nodded, and as Jenks buried himself in my hair, I closed my eyes to block out the dizzy sensation. Behind me, I felt the train race on without the mystics. The splinter was following me, harrowing, nipping, stabbing at my heels. Ill and nauseated, I hung in Etude’s grip, thinking that I should have just called the damn eagles from the beginning and done this alone.

A solid book. 

Onward!
