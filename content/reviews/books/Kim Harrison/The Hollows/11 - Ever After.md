> Everyone needed someone to watch their back. 

It's the end of the world[^world]--and it might just be Rachel's fault[^fault]. 

[^world]: Yes, but *which* world? :smile:

[^fault]: Well, she didn't *mean* to blow a whole in reality. But still. 

So now she has to do the impossible, save the world--magic itself--face off against Ku'Sox[^audio], and somehow work with both Trent and Al at the same time. 

[^audio]: I listen to these. I ... did *not* realize/remember that's how that is spelled. 

What could *possibly* go wrong? 

(A lot. A lot could go wrong.)

Oy.
