title: The Outlaw Demon Wails
---
Okay, enough side stories (and [[The Turn: The Hollows Begins with Death|prequels]]()!). Back to the main story. 

So, Rachel can do demon things. And in doing so, she's managed to really piss off one demon: Algaliarept (Al). Now he's out every night on a technicality and coming for Rachel. 

> “You can’t forget anything,” I said, watching the words vanish into nothing. “And even if you do, it always comes back to bitch-slap you in the morning.”

So how in the world is she going to solve this one? Well... perhaps not in *the world* after all.

> “Rache?” Jenks said warily, hovering as I hid my hands so he couldn’t see them shake. “What did you do?”

:smile:

On top of that, more elf shenanigans with Trent and Ceri (although not the two of them together :whew:). 

Relationship drama, both with Ivy and perhaps with Marshal (from [[A Fistful of Charms]]()). It's not quite Kistin, but it will be interesting to see. And uniting auras. What's up with that? A mystery for another book I suppose. 

Oh, and historical drama with Rachel's mom (now that was a bombshell...). I figured something was up with that, but man that was still a hit. It will be interesting to see where that goes--and if her mom will become a larger player going forward. 

Oh, and suddenly Ryn Cormel. Who I just met in [[The Turn: The Hollows Begins with Death|The Turn]](). Interesting that. If I hadn't read the prequel, would I have missed out on anything? Probably not. 

Oh, and a Gargoyle. I expected more from that. But perhaps next book. 

I *really* enjoyed this one. This series has turned out to be primarily about demons, but... perhaps that makes sense given, well, everything. I'm here for it though!

Side note: I've been listening to these on audiobok. Why... does this one have a different narrator? It's a bit jarring. Piss-ker-ee. Lee line. Jenks' new voice. I think it'd be perfectly fine (although lee line would probably still bother me), but I'd just gotten so used to the other!

It turns out [there is a discussion about this](https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/21045927-a-change-in-narrator-for-this-book) on Goodreads. 

> Ms. Gavin and I are both working to get her to read AMERICAN DEMON. Should happen!

Not a why, but at least it's known? And apparently we'll go back to Marguerite Gavin after this one!

Second side note: The fact that they said 'Al went into human resources' is certainly a choice. And they just skate *right on* by that one.
