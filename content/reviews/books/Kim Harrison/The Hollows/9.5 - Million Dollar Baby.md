Another novella from [[Into the Woods: Tales from the Hollows and Beyond|Into the Woods]](): The story of what Jenks and Trent were up to during [[Pale Demon]](). 

**ELF QUEST!**

It's really quite spoilery (for Pale Demon) to really get into what that *actually* means, but the short version is that we get another major magical heist novel, which is all sorts of fun. 

Trent and Jenks are a surprisingly fun combo. It's nice every once in a while to have parts about Rachel without having her on screen. 

> “No, not really.” One hand holding his wings tight to his body, Jenks turned to look behind him at their forward progress. “Rachel makes enough mistakes in one week to fill a twenty-yard dump truck.”

Exactly. 

Oh, and more elf politics:

> He trusted people. He trusted quite a few, and quite a few had “screwed him over” as Jenks put it. The difference was that when people betrayed him, sometimes other people died. And then other people thought it was his fault. He was tired of it. Everything he had was at risk for the next four hours. Quen said he was not his father, but he was doing the same damning things. ... The Goddess help him, they had to come out of the closet if only so he could stop killing people.

A fun short story! And with even *more* implications to the broader Hollows universe than Pale Demon. It'll be interesting to see how that all shakes out.

Onward!
