Okay, I've read (and quite enjoyed) enough of the Hollows that I want to go back and pick up the short stories and other supplementary stories.

Enter: The Turn.

The story of science, betrayal, tomatoes, and a whole bunch of deaths that changed the world. 

It's a fun story. While I really do appreciate that the Hollows is a world with without a 'masquerade', it's fascinating to see the world before (and *as*) all of the various Interlanders came out into the open. Especially seeing who was involved--and wondering just what they're all up to in the more modern time I've been reading.

Overall, a fun story to set up. As far as I've read, I don't think it's necessary to read for the main series, but I'ms till glad to have read it. 

Onward!
