Yup. 

All that vampire/demon business of the previous book? Causing all sorts of chaos this time around. 

Rachel, remaining entirely *absolutely sure she is right about everything to the detriment of everyone around her*? Also chaos-causing. 

Nick-trauma and Rachel not realizing that 'thing never done before' was causing some serious issues? Chaos. 

Nick is out of town, so totally platonic date with Kristen[^spelling]. Who apparently has murdered people, because... duh? Vampire?[^vampire], but he promised not to do it anymore. Chaos. 

[^spelling]: Reading these on audiobook. That's how his name is spelled? Huh. 

[^vampire]: I feel like this world at least has some chance at actually 'good' vampires without all the complexity of 'they *need blood* to live' you usually get, at least for the living vamps. But really, they're natural predators who feed on people. You're going to need more than 'they deserved it'. 

I do appreciate seeing Demon Al as an actual *demon*. Holding a prisoner for a thousand years. I'm just waiting for an attempted redemption arc there, but as it is it *feels good* when Rachel gets one over on him. And Ceri has some interesting potential. 

Oh these books. Onwards!
