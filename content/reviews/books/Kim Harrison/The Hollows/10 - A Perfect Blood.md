title: A Perfect Blood
---
So Rachel's still alive and full on recognized as a demon...

Except demons *don't* live in reality. They have no rights. They don't exist. And they most certainly register cars. 

Oh the paperwork. 

> “I should’ve kept my mouth shut,” he said, shooting a quick glance at the knots, and I shrugged. Perhaps, but there was no sense in crying over squished tomatoes.

Oh. And Rachel's avoiding her magic, Trent's embracing his, and an anti-interland hate group is of course up to *no* good. 

> “I’m not so sure.” Something always seemed to break their way. HAPA was like mint. You could rip it up, and six months later, it was back, healthier than ever. Mint smelled better, though, and you could make juleps out of it. I don’t know what I could make out of HAPA. Compost, maybe.

Good times. 

For the reader at least. 

Onward!

Also: I don't know if we've ever had this confirmed, but both of Trent's mother parents are dead. Given what we learned [[The Turn: The Hollows Begins with Death|The Turn]](), I really expected her to show up. 

Also also: Darryl? Like from [[Ley Line Drifter]]()? That was a surprise. 

Also x3: Man Harrison gets stuck on catch phrases sometimes. This time around, it was 'bunny ear kiss kiss'. 6 times, but I don't think she's said it at all and now it's everyone. 

Forealso: 

> I guess I hadn’t watched the right movies to know that with ultimate power comes ultimate responsibility. My blood was power, and I had a responsibility to keep it safe—even if that meant I had to hurt someone in the short term.
