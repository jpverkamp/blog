And away we go!

Where [[Dead Witch Walking]]() set up the world, it's here where we really start setting up Rachel Morgan and go as investigators in their own right. And of course, they've stumbled right into a serial killer targeting leyline witches. Good times that. 

There is quite the cast of characters this time around. Trent Kamalack is back and as morally 'totally morally gray, but maybe for good reasons' kind of person--and we do get to learn the what/why he is, which is neat.

> “Come work for me, and I’ll tell you.”  
> My eyes went to his. “You are a thief, a cheat, a murderer, and a not-nice man,” I said calmly. “I don’t like you.”  
> He shrugged, the motion making him look utterly harmless. “I’m not a thief,” he said. “And I don’t mind manipulating you into working for me when I need it.” He smiled, showing me perfect teeth. “I enjoy it, actually.”   

Head local vamp Piscary is scary and understated. Rachel's mother is wacky. Her father... had secrets. And Nick... well, I'm happy if Rachel is happy, but that is so not going to go well. 

Worldbuildingwise, getting more into what exactly layline magic is, how demons work in this world (parallel reality that's not *really* Hell go!), how these vampires are different, and more 'humans are terrified of tomatoes' than you can shake a stick at. It's a fun world and I always like seeing how many different ways you can turn common tropes. 

On another hand... man Rachel is kind of an idiot sometimes. She's so absolutely sure shre's right even when *everyone* around her is trying to get her see the truth. Oy that was frustrating. One would htink that trying to set out on her own would make her a little more risk averse--but I suppose that's not in the cards. 

And oh, that climax. This is most certainly going to come back and bite Rachel. But honestly, what other choice did she even have? 

Overall, it's a fun series and I'm happy to keep going. Onward!
