title: For a Few Demons More
---
> There were no more choices, no more options, no more clever ways out of a tough situation. And the rush, I realized in a brutal wash of despair, is a false god I’ve chased my entire life. One that cost me everything in the blind search for sensation. My entire existence amounted to nothing.

That title is not a lie...

Not just Algaliarept (Al :smile:) this time around. We also are introduced to Newt--just sort of pops in and shows off some serious magical chops... and then reveals that she's not entirely sane any more. Mildly terrifying that. Plus Minias, her minder, who actually seems decent--for a demon. Rachel is getting in pretty hard with all of these different favors owed (both ways). Makes for quite the story. 

On top of that Trent's getting married. And Rachel's not only invited... but in the wedding party? Well, actually it's to provide security (hint: demons). But of course any time you put Trent and Rachel together there's going to be trouble. 

And if *that* wasn't enough... we have even more vampire trouble. Rachel and Ivy are such a mess--and that one really can't last too many more books. One step forward--and another two back. And Kisten. Oh Kisten. Still not a good person, but perhaps good for Rachel? {{<spoiler>}}Oh Harrison, *that* was a low blow.{{</spoiler>}}

> I’ve got your back. Nothing alive will ever hurt you if I have breath in me. And nothing dead will hurt you if I don’t.

Man that's a story. Probably the most intense so far. I fully expect (and hope) that this really shakes up the world of the Hollows and I'm curious where in the *world* we can go from here. 

Onward!
