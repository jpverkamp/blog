So that's a story. Young Rachel (finishing school, desperately wanting to go to the IS), still living at home with her mother, when her brother comes to visit! Given that we've barely seen them on page (*have* we see her brother?), it's some fun bit of backstory...

And then the entire story revolves around trying to contact Rachel's dead father to win a bet (and to join the IS in his footsteps), well, of course things are going to get complicated. 

It's a fun story with just the right amount of gut punches and backstory. I do wonder what we'll see 'in between'. How does Rachel end up strong enough to go on runs? She certainly isn't doing that well here. And will see see her time at that camp? 

Overall, worth the read!

Side note: red eye flights being renamed to 'vamp flights' is a fun detail. 

Also: 'Spell checker'. :smile:

Also also: Man Rachel really will fall for anyone, won't she...
