title: A Fistful of Charms
---
Okay, enough vampire/demon nonsense for a moment, let's talk about weres. 

> As the joke goes, you donâ€™t have to be faster than the wolf chasing you, just faster than everyone else running away.

Turns out that trying to get letter-of-the-law against multiple packs of werewolves has consequences. For everyone involved. 

Nick... is a real piece of work. I will grant him the one small saving grace that he (along with most of the world) thought Rachel dead as part of [[Every Which Way But Dead]]()[^title]... but that doesn't make him any better a person. At least Rachel eventually realizes it? Sort of. Mostly. Ish. 

[^title]: Which is an amusing title given that. 

Rachel and Ivy... come to a serious head in this book. Which went about as badly as I expected. I do wish the best for Ivy, but she certainly doesn't make that easy at times and Rachel is *not* helping matters here. 

It (among a number of other plotlines in these books) are yet a bit more of Rachel being so sure she's right and never quite taking responsibility for when that goes sidewise. 

Jenks? I am *so* glad to see him back again. The whole running off because of not being trusted last book, I get that. But Jenks is just so fun.


> "Plan B?" Ivy said. "What is plan B?"  
> Jenks reddened. "Grab the fish and run like hell," he muttered, and I almost giggled.

And now there's a *whole lot more* Jenks. Which ... kind of weird and I don't really get it. I do wonder if that's going to be a recurring theme or was a one off. Half-related, the entire premise that Pixies only live ~20 years and Jenks is just about there? I'm not sure how to deal with this. 

Overall, a fun read and I appreciated a new set of problems. Onward!

Side note: Trent's near complete absense was a bit strange. On one hand, it's not his flavor of nonsense going on this time around, so it makes sense. But on the other hand, we have crime and rare artifacts, I fully expected that to bring him in.
