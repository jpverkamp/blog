title: The Weakness
---
Oof. Two in a row I don't overly care for. 

This time around, we have Jake out of town...

> <A vote,> Tobias said. <It's the only way.>
> 
> Marco snorted. "Beautiful. Let's see. We've got Rachel's best friend and her bird-friend and Ax isn't voting . . . forget it, man. I'm out."
> 
> Marco turned to me and bowed. "Congratulations, your highness. Your wish is my command."

And for some reason Rachel steps up. I don't mean to agree with Marco too strongly here... but this is a bad idea. 

Hit and run, almost get killed, learn a lesson. 

And away we go!

Side note, at least we do get this delightful conversation:

> "Look, Mommy!" I whipped around to see some little boy yanking on his mother's jeans and pointing at Marco. "It's Curious George!"
> 
> <Hey, little dude, I'm a gorilla. Curious George is a monkey. Lady, you should buy your kid an encyclopedia!> Marco picked up a slightly smashed box from the floor. <How about investing in a CD-ROM version? Zillions magazine, the Consumer Repcrt, for kids' rates . . .>
> 
> "WAAAAAAH! Curious George is mean!"
