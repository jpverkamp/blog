 Not ... exactly?

That's a very weird book. A what if sort of future and even at the end, it's not entirely clear what's happening. 

Especially back to back with [[Back to Before]](). 

We've done this sort of thing before, but usually with at least some small amount of closure. 

Not my favorite.
