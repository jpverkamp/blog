title: The Separation
---
That's... a really strange story. And hard to talk about without spoiling the main conceit, which they at least seem to want to keep semi-hidden. 

<!--more-->

{{<spoiler>}}In a nutshell, Rachel gets cut in half and ends up demorphing into two split personalities. 'Mean Rachel', who is impulsive and angry to a fault and 'Nice Rachel', who we don't see quite as often, but also has all the abilities to plan.{{</spoiler>}}

It's an interesting enough conceit, but as happens with many of these kinds of stories, it all feels entirely too... artificial. People are complicated. You can just pick and choose traits like that. I guess that's the point--Rachel needs everything that makes her who she is--but I don't think the story quite landed it. 

So it goes. 

Onward!
