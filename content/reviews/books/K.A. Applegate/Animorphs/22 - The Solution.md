title: The Solution
---
And so The Solution to the David Trilogy ([[The Discovery]]() and [[The Threat]]()). 

Oy. 

Sometimes there *are* no good solutions. This becomes increasingly clear as the series goes on. 

But oh, this one. This is one of the hardest to justify. 

It do not like this storyline. It's well written and I think needed to be told. Still don't like it.

> "Marco," I said, once I had demorphed. "You know you're a toad?"
> 
> "Kiss me and I'll become a prince," he said without hesitation. "I'll be The Prince Formerly Known As Toad. You know you want me. You can't help it. After all, you're a female and I'm . . . well, I'm me."
> 
> "Yeah, that's the real Marco," I said dryly.
> 
> Cassie laughed. "Believe me, we all did the same kind of thing. I asked him to tell me what it was like when we morphed trout. Just to test his memory."
> 
> "And I answered that it wasn't bad except that the cracker-crumb coating chafed a little and I was allergic to tartar sauce. Now can you all stop playing that game? I'm afraid I'll miss a punch line and Rachel will morph to grizzly and eat me before I have a chance to say anything."
