Uh oh. 

And so we're really in the endgame now. Things are falling apart. The Yeerks have all the power. And the Animorphs... well, they have that they've always had. 

Hope.

Random thoughts:

I hadn't really thought about it before, but... why can't the Chee make the call? Because it would lead to violence? Could they help the Animorphs make a call? Would that be indirect enough?

About a chapter later:

> <The Chee cannot participate or assist in the transfer of technology that could enable war and destruction,> Ax explained. <It is written into their programming.>

Yeah, fine. 

> "Ax, you're amazing," Cassie said.

> Ax looked at Dad and flashed one of his eye-smiles.

> <At times you humans truly scare me,> he muttered softly. <A mere four decades from first orbital spaceflight to the discovery of Zero-space communication?> He stamped the dirt with a hoof for emphasis. <We Andalites may wish we had left you to the Yeerks.>
> 
> "So far you Andalites have left us to the Yeerks," Rachel pointed out dryly.

It does make me wish for a post Animorphs series. A decade or two, maybe a century in the future. Quite a different beast to write though.
