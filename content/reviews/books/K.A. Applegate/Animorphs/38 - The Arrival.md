The Andalites have arrived!

Sort of. 

Things go well. 

> Rachel whirled around. Her face red with anger. "I'm through taking orders from you," she said through clenched teeth. "I'm through with Marco and his stupid jokes. I'm through with Cassie's hypocrisy."
> 
> Cassie took a broom from the corner and began to sweep up the glass. "Count me out, too," she said softly. "If this war is unwinnable, how do we justify killing Hork-Bajir? Basically, they're prisoners of war. Innocent victims."
> 
> Marco thrusts his hands into his pockets. "Guess I'm out, too. I'm going to enjoy what time I've got left. Acquire a surfer dude chick magnet. Hang out."

It would be nice to meet some fine upstanding examples of Andalite society. 

Today... is not that day. 

It's a solid story. It's a nice contrast to Ax's earlier conflict between his people... and his people.
