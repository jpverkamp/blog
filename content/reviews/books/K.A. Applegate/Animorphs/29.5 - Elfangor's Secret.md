Way to bury the lede there. 

So... it's another time travel story. Another Time Matrix story. Another Ellimist / Cyarak story. 

The slightly more interesting bit this time is that time is wrong. Someone has been messing around in history and it's up to the Animorphs to put things right.

It's... fine? It's probably the weakest of the time travel stories and when there are enough to say 'one of the time travel stories' you know it's played out. 

Onward!
