So... the one with the Helmacrons. 

They're small. And very angry. 

It's kind of weird just how many aliens there are/have been wondering about the Earth. And this is no exception. 

Plus, the idea of tiny aliens is (for the most part) played for laughs, rather than really digging into how in *the world* that would work. How does anything work at that scale? 

Not one of my favorites. 

So it goes. 

Onward!

Well. That's... a thing. Almost as weird for the sake of being weird as the reveal about their captains...

Also... why do the morphs shrink? Maybe the tech is relative to your size. Sure. But then why *wouldn't* newly acquired morphs also shrink? Shrinking is just weird.
