title: The Conspiracy
---
It's an odd one to pair with [[The Reunion]](). In both cases, we have an Animorph with a family member controller. In both cases, it's too close to home. But Marco made the call--even if it's going to tear him up later to do it. 

Now it's Jake's turn.

> You know what Marco and I used to talk about? Whether Batman could beat Spiderman. Whether Sega was better than Nintendo. Whether some girl would rather go out with him or me.
> 
> And now . . .
> 
> "What are we, anymore, Marco? What has happened to us?"
> 
> He didn't answer. I didn't expect him to. We both knew what had happened.

Man these books get dark. 

That's one reason I like them. They don't get into everything, but they really do get into enough.
