Whelp, it seems [[The Extreme]]() wasn't *extreme* enough. Forget the Arctic, now the Animorphs are going to a world far, *far* away. 

It's a(nother) precursor to [[todo:The Ellimist Chronicles]](), detailing that long, *long* battle between the Ellimist and Crayak.

> "But it wasn't to be that simple. Approximately a hundred million Earth years ago, we became aware of a new force in the galaxy. Not a species, an individual. He was a fugitive from another galaxy, chased out of that galaxy by a power even greater than he. Greater than me."

This time around, it's a contest of champions: the Animorphs (plus Erek the Chee) versus Howlers (they killed the Chee's creators, thus Erek). 

It's *quite* the weird world. And quite the battle(s). And of course... quite the solution out of left field. Turns out even strengths can be turned into a weakness if you're ... human enough? 

An interesting story, if a little weird. 

Onward!
