FLASH.

The one with a big ball of wibbly wobbly... time-y wimey... stuff.

There's weird tension (did he finally go crazy?) and a neat resolution (possibly, but at least this time around he's not) that theoretically raises some big interesting world building problems--that we probably won't ever have to deal with. 

It's a good one.

Random thoughts (spoilers!):

Such delightful technobabble. The Andelites really do like naming things after random people, but I suppose we do the same thing all the time. 

Also, I love Ax's (probably unintentional) humor here. 

> I sat staring at the piranha. They say a school of piranha can strip a cow down to nothing but bones in a few minutes.

Totally something a teen, especially of the area, would think. Also... somewhat overblow. 

Also also, they should have acquired piranha morphs!
