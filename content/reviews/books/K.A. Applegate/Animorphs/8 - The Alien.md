Our first point of view of Ax. Who's an alien (oh so alien).

It's a fun look at cultural differences. I generally think that the series badly overdoes how he's constantly reacting to things like speaking/eating/standing on two legs, but it's fun to see it from his point of view. 

Culturally, we do get a decent bit of interesting story building here. What makes humans interesting in this universe. What Andelite culture is built on. What families are like. Etc. 

It's a neat story. 

I'm glad that the core conflict doesn't (for the most part) get drug beyond one book. That would get tiring.

## Random Thoughts

(minor thoughts)

More random species names *go*!

> "What type of ship is that?" I asked. "It looks somewhat like a Hawjabran freighter."

Came out in 97 so probably First Contact, out in 96. Amusing. 

> I quickly became bored by the plot of the movie. For one thing, there was one character who was clearly an Ongachic female. But in the movie this creature was called a "Klingon." It made no sense.

I haven't actually decided if I like this more or less than just physical descriptions or not even that. 

Also:

> He reached up with one weakened hand. I took his hand in mine. <Fight them. They are stronger than you think. They have . . . they have infiltrated . . .they are on the home world . . . fight . . .>

I don't recall this ever being mentioned again... I wonder if I just don't recall or if this too was dropped.
