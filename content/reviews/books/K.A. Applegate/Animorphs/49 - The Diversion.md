> "No, Rachel. We retreat," Jake answered. "A tactical retreat. Save the army. Live to fight another day. But a toothbrush would be good. And extra deodorant. We'll be out there a while."

Random thoughts (spoilers):

> Sara and Jordan are fine, Aunt Naomi," Jake said, in his talking-to-psycho-relatives voice. "And so are you. Ax?" He raised his voice, but kept it calm. "Can you make sure Rachel's sisters don't go anywhere?"
> 
> Little girl giggles erupted from the living room.
> 
> <I have already made sure, Prince Jake. They think I am a "pokey man." I have told them I am an Andalite and am actually quite swift, but they insist they need to train me.>

That's a fun scene. 

> Cassie had tried to explain it. "Morphing can fix injuries," she said, "because all the information needed to re-create the cell is stored within your DNA. But memories? How are those stored? As electrical impulses? As part of your soul? When they're gone, maybe they're just . . . gone."

Or perhaps because the science / the rules never quite 100% makes sense. ðŸ˜ƒ

And that's okay!
