title: The Resistance
---
Things continue to escalate. 

The free Hork-Bajir under attack, willing to die to defend their homes. With some Animorph help. 

And two hundred years ago, but not all that different, Union soldiers under attack, willing to die to defend their homes. 

With some freed slaves willing to help. 

In the end, it's the same battle, time and again. And the same people--black, white, and Hork-Bajir alike--willing to step up to fight 

It's a neat structure, interweaving the two battles. A solid read.
