title: In the Time of Dinosaurs

I mean, it's right there in the title right? 

The Animorphs try to do the right thing and instead get blown back 65 million years in the past. They almost get eaten, find a bunch of aliens no one has ever heard of (and we'll never see again I expect), almost get eaten, go steal a nuke, almost get eaten, and eventually get home. Because what sort of series would this be if they didn't...

I'm starting to think that the Animorphs might have a time travel problem.

Although, I guess it's been longer than than I thought since last time ([[The Stranger]](), [[The Forgotten]](), and [[The Andalite Chronicles]](); alternatively, it was last 65 million years from now!).

In any case, it's certainly an exciting story. And we get a touch of the moral issues involved in potentially changing the timeline--or having to allow something terrible to happen to preserve it. Along with some much more interesting aliens than we often see. 

So a good story. Worthy of the heftier Megamorphs page count I think. 

Onward and back... TO THE FUTURE!

Random thoughts:

So... why in the world does morphing not heal Tobias' wing? Nothing we know about how morphing or time travel suggests that shouldn't have worked. And the others healed--or at least I assume, since Rachel doesn't have problems with her feet any more after morphing. 

I suppose it could have been something the Ellimist messed up?
