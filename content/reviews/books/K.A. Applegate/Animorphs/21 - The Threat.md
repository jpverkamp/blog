And so continues the David saga ([[The Discovery]]() and [[The Solution]]()). 

In this one, the new Animorph is put *entirely* under the test. A meeting of world leaders. One (at least) is already a Controller[^pools]. 

Good times. 

It's interesting seeing David fit in--and even more so when he doesn't.

Onward!

Additional random delightful dialog:

[^pools]: So... how does this actually work? Are there Yeerk pools in other countries? Or even in DC, since I'm pretty sure Animorphs is set on the West Coast, probably in Southern California. Do they travel? If there are more Yeerk Pools, how do the Animorphs have any chance at all? Why don't the Yeerks just... go somewhere else? 

    They actually even mention this (with Tony being stuck in Washington). So... how does it work?
