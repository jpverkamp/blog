---
Nightmares within nightmares. 

Among all the Animorphs, they'd all say that there's only one who might be truly sad if the war ended tomorrow: Rachel. 

But even the most gung ho fighter is eventually going to burn out. Perhaps *especially* them. 

An intense book with all the surreal uncertainty of the worst nightmares.
