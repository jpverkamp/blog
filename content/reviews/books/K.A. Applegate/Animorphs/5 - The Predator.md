The one with Marco's backstory. 

Two years ago his mother died/disappeared at sea. In that time, his father has not really taken that well, leading to a somewhat rough home life. 

Meanwhile, Ax tries to call home. This also goes poorly, although probably not how you'd expect. 

Capture! A trip to SPACE! Power struggles among the Yeerks! And... a surprise visit from Visser One. 

An interesting twist that. Doesn't make any more sense than a random Assistant Principal being a high placed local Controller, but it works for the book. 

Slightly weaker than [[The Encounter]]() and [[The Message]](), but there's potential for some interesting stories in the future.

## Random thoughts

(minor spoilers)

> We hoped there were no bird-watchers down in the woods. We made a very unlikely flock - a red-tailed hawk, a falcon, a harrier, a bald eagle, and two ospreys.

See! One eagle/two ospreys. A (very minor) mistake in [[The Encounter]]().

> <More Hork-Bajir back here! And some of those other ones. The little wrinkled ones!> Cassie yelled. <They're coming fast!>

And... we still have only hints of these 'other' species. It's common enough worldbuilding (hint at more depth) but it feels sloppy to me. 

## Dated References

> The mall was a zoo. Wall-to-wall people. Old people moving real slow. Married people with squalling babies in big huge strollers. High school kids trying to look cool. Mall police trying to look tough. Good-looking girls carrying bags from The Limited.

Malls again. But also *The Limited*. You know, I actually thought this was a made up brand for the book (which I suppose given the next examples doesn't make that much sense). It just isn't the sort of store I have any interest in for some reason :smile:. 

In any case, they shut down most of their stores through the 2010s, with the last closing in 2017.

Basically gone as of 2015. Has apparently gone through bankruptcy a number of times with different owners since. 

And Circuit City is more dated at this point (2009), although it lasted online until ~2012.
