... 

Right.

So... remember that big weird biomechanical appearance at the end of [[The Capture]]()? 

> "I am an Ellimist," he said, speaking with an actual voice, "as your Andalite friend guessed."

> "Be at peace, Andalite," the Ellimist said. "Look at your human friends. They do not fear me."

> <They don't know what you are,> Ax managed to say.
> 
> The Ellimist smiled. "Neither do you. All you know are the fairy stories your people tell to children."

I remember [[todo:The Ellimist Chronicles]]() being one of my favorite books of the series. I did *not* remember that they showed up quite so early. An interesting bit of worldbuilding, if nearing on an almost *literal* deus-ex-machina. 

It's a good book, but it's tonally weird compared to any of the books thus far--quite a jump in scope/scale. 

Although I do like Rachel's cover / new combat morph though. Not *quite* as many size issues as she had with the elephant.

## Random Thoughts

(minor spoilers)

> <Twenty-eight of your minutes have passed since Cassie and Rachel entered morph.>
> 
> <You know, Ax, they're your minutes now, too.> Marco said, just to make conversation. <I mean, we are all here together on good old Earth where we only have one type of minute.>

And so begins yet another of those running jokes that will be in *every single book after this one*. 

> <They are going perhaps three hundred or more of your miles per hour.>
> 
> "They're everyone's miles," Marco said. "You're on Earth, Ax. We all have the same miles."
> 
> <What about nations that use kilometers?> Ax asked smugly. <See? I am learning.>

Yeah, okay. That's an amusing take on it.
