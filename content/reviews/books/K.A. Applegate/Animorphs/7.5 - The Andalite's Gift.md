The first [[Megamorphs]]() book--with the point of view switching each chapter rather than per book--and almost twice as long! (apparently it was originally published as two books?) It's a neat concept and a good way to shake up the series. 

Other than that, it's summer time. The Animorphs are coming off a [[The Stranger|big win]](). So it's time to relax. 

Until a living tornado from Saturn comes to visit--seemingly focussed on finding and shredding our friendly neighborhood Animorphs. 

Also, an amnesia plot. Which morphing for some reason didn't heal? 

It's... fine? The other [[Megamorphs]]() books are better.

## Random Thoughts

> "You said you could drive!" Cassie accused.

> I shrugged. Actually, what I had said was I scored millions of points playing Wipeout, this excellent video game. "Okay, so it's not exactly like Wipeout. I'm doing the best I can."

It is an enjoyable game. 

Man they're young.

Why don't they just go back on the YouTube video? Or look up someone live streaming it?!
