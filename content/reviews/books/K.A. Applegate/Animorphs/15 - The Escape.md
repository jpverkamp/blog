Marco books have some of the best snippets.

> I jumped in, feet first, around the eight-foot marker. I bobbed back up to the surface and said, "This is insane, Marco."
> 
> To which I answered, "So I'll be careful."
> 
> To which I countered, "You're talking to yourself, do you know that?"
> 
> "Oh, shut up," I said. 

And:

> "You know, sometimes there's just a very fine line between us and the Three Stooges," I said.
> 
> <What are stooges?> Ax asked.
> 
> "A stooge is a guy stupid enough to run around inside a Yeerk stronghold wearing a pair of bike shorts and accompanied by a Deer-man from outer space and a mouse-eating Bird-boy. That's a stooge."

Also, SHARKS!

They're the Hork-Bajir of the sea! Apparently literally. It's an odd one to pair right fater [[The Unknown]](). Back to back books talking about non-human/animal Controllers, although with rather different outcomes. And now I want to look up the differences between shark and horse brains...

Plus, we get an appearance by a new, interesting race (mind reading amphibians!), more Visser One scenes (of course, it's a Marco points of view)/Visser Three politics, and some underwater adventures, which are neat. 

Overall, a decent entry. Up from [[The Change]]() and [[The Unknown]](), I think. 

Onward!

Random thoughts (minor spoilers):

> In this mall was a restaurant called the Amazon Cafe. It was a cool restaurant because it was like going on some ride at Disney World.

So, this is a weird one. I'd been thinking that the Gardens was a stand in for Disney Land (mostly because of the licensed characters), but now we straight up have a reference to Disney World. Across the country... but still. 

> <Now, this is an interesting human concept,> Ax said approvingly. <This hologram makes it almost appear that we are under the water.>
> 
> "Ax? It's not a hologram," Rachel said.
> 
> <Then . . . we are underwater? Protected only by badly made human plastic?>
> 
> "Yeah."
> 
> <Why do you humans do things like this?>

It's an interesting point of view I suppose. 

> <We're still our old selves, aren't we? I mean, we haven't changed. Not really. No matter what, right?>
> 
> <Sure, Marco.>
> 
> <No, I mean it.> I realized I had grown very serious. I don't know why, but I wanted Jake to agree with me. It was important to me. <We're still just us. Nothing that happens can really change what you are. Right?>
> 
> We flapped side-by-side back to the others.
> 
> <Look, Marco,> Jake said wearily. <I'm not exactly a philosopher, okay?>
> 
> <Yeah. Well, I'm me, no matter what,> I said defiantly. <No matter how many morphs, no matter how many battles. No matter what. I'll still be me. Everyone better accept that.>
> 
> Jake laughed a little. <Marco, if it makes you feel any better, you'll always just be a punk to me.>
> 
> I had to laugh, too. <Thanks,> I said.

Although we'll get far more of this in [[The Warning]]() (coming soon!), it is interesting seeing these characters start to grapple with the absolute *insanity* of what they're doing. 

If they weren't protagonists in a book series... they'd have been dead a dozen times over.
