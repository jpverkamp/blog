> I know it seems impossible even to conceive of Andalites as traitors. I know the very idea makes any decent Andalite sick inside. But I am telling the truth. The Ascalin incident happened. We were betrayed by one of our own.

Quite the introduction, that. 

Another high level person threatened with a Yeerkening. A mad plan to get in and turn it to their advantage... 

And then suddenly *yoink*. You're in a war on another planet, a billion miles away. 

Turns out even vanishingly unlikely things can happen if you're the protagonists of a book!

This one kind of bothered me.

Huh. This feels like midi-chlorians. Something that's probably better not being too accurately portrayed. 

But now that they have... does your body replicate this DNA? Does it go with you to every morph? Can you bleed it out?
