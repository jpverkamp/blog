title: The Ellimist Chronicles

> My full name is Azure Level, Seven Spar, Extension Two, Down-Messenger, Forty-one. My chosen name is Toomin. I like the sound of the word, which is all the reason you need for a chosen name.
> 
> My "game" name is Ellimist. Like Toomin, it doesn't mean anything in particular. I just thought it sounded breezy. Never occurred to me when I chose the name that it would follow me for so long, and so far.

A world of flying crystals. Searchers, flying to the stars. A living moon. And all along, games. Games at an unimaginable scale. 

Perhaps my favorite book of the whole series--although it's for the most part completely inconsequential to any of the other books. It explains a few things (that were acceptable not to explain) and builds more worlds (perhaps connecting things too much). Still, I quite enjoy this one. And it's at a good point. 

The beginning.

And the end.
