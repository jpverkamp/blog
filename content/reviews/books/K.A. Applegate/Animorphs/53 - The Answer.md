My name is Jake.
> 
> My name is Jake Berenson. The days of secrecy, of lurking in the shadows are over. The Yeerks know my name. They know my height, weight, eye color, Social Security number, and favorite foods. At long last they know the word Animorph, Marco's word for us.
> 
> I've fought them for more than three years. I was just thirteen when I started. I'm sixteen now, though that fact, like so many facts, has been deliberately obscured in the secret accounts we've kept.
> 
> I'm a sixteen-year-old kid named Jake Berenson, and I am the leader of the Animorphs.

More battles, bigger than ever before. Characters we've met long ago, back where we'd never expect them. And choices. Choices that could charge the whole galaxy. 

It all comes back to the power to morph. 

And the choices the Animorphs will all have to make. And live with. 

Or die by. 

One more book.

Random thoughts (minor spoilers):

> "I am. And not just this body, by the way, but me. I've subjected my own true Yeerk self to the cube. You want to know what's funny? I can morph Tom. That's right, I can morph into my own host body. Cool, huh? But there are all these other Yeerks who are never going to get the chance to be free."

And there it is. It's usually the hosts morphing, but the Yeerks can too. It's still weird.
