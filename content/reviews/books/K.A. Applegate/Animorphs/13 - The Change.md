Yes. Spoilers. The Ellimist is around. 

And since this originally released the same day as [[The Andalite Chronicles]]()--and because it's a Tobias book, you had to expect it. 

In short, the Ellimist is (totally not :wink:) interfering to free some Hork-Bajir. Tobias gets roped in. We do learn a lot more about Hork-Bajir (more than we will really until somewhat later in [[The Hork-Bajir Chronicles]]()). It's a good thing to be doing. 

And yet, I still totally get Tobias lamenting getting jerked around like that. 

But in the end--it was all worth it?

Random thoughts (spoilers): 

We don't learn the details until much later in [[todo:The Ellimist Chronicles]](), but it does make me wonder... what did the Ellimist give up to be able to do this?
