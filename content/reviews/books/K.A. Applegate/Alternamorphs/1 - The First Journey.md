Huh, I didn't know they made these!

Animorphs, but choose your own adventure style. 

Neat idea, subpar execution. 

Each of the 'choices' has only one correct answer. There are no branches and every dead end sees you killed and reset. And even with that, it's barely 3/4 the length of most of the Animorph books--already short. 

So... meh? There are only two. We'll see if I read the other.
