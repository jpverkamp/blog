The third book of [[The Memoirs of Lady Trent]](). First she went to studing dragons in rocky mountanious islands--and almost died. And then she spent some time studying river dragons deep in the jungle--and almost died. 

And now she's off on a voyage around the world--akin to Darwin's [[wiki:Voyage of the Beagle]]()--to study dragons. Only to almost die not once, not twice, but at least three times. Assuming I didn't miss any. 

Oh, and have all manner of other adventures along the way. 

> “I have never attempted to hide that I have had two husbands in my life. I have, however, neglected to mention that in between them, I had a wife.” 

In *any* case. 

> “That should be my epitaph when I die: 'she did not have to do it'.” 

I'm still loving riding along with the titular Lady Trent on her adventures and learning all about how dragons work in this world right along with her. And this time, she's actually bringing her son along, which gives a whole new dimension to the journeys--for the most part. 

A fun book. I expect if you'll like the first two, you'll continue to enjoy this one. 

Onward!
