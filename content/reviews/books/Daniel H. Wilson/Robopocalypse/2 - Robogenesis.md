> And now the story begins for the last time.

So. That hint that it wasn't all over? That was just the beginning.

> We are all expressions of our own minds, projected onto the world.

The idea that the AI that lead to the end of the world wasn't a unique event--just one that happened to go particularly sideways is a fascinating one. The story of people trying to rebuild in the ruins--only for another war to sweep over what's left is terrifying. And the 'what comes next' of animal like machines, augmented humans, and self-aware / free robots is a fascinating basis for a story. 

> What is a mind, but a pattern? My mind or yours. Man or machine. Simply an arrangement of atoms. Each of us, a unique expression of the mind of the universe.

Honestly, I still think that [[Robopocalypse]]() could stand as it's own--and was the stronger book. But if it had to have a sequel, this was an interesting one. Now that we have it (and that I've read it!) I feel like we're going to need at least one more. There are just so many ideas here, we need to go another step further!

> But instead of the end, Iâ€™m pretty sure I found myself at the start of something.

Onward!
