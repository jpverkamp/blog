Crazy collection of short stories. And some weird connections between them. Two (really) stories where people just leave their skin alone:

<!--more-->

A story about Blackbeard the Pirate... what is it with Hellboy and detached heads? I guess it's a common method of execution.  

A statue that bleeds.  

A mole that takes over life, leaving Hellboy's skin behind (again, see).  

Oh, and Mulengeons.

Appalachia? You're just as weird as everywhere else...  

Overall, a solid collection of shorts with little in the way of the bigger story. But well done nevertheless.
