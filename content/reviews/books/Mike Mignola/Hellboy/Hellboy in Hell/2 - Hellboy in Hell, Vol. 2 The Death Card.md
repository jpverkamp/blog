Two in a day? Yes!  

 **1: The Death Card**

Bumping into a couple of souls trying to go on as they did in life and impose some sense of order onto Hell? That's a fascinating idea. And helpful. And hey, the whole 'see them as alive, turn around and they're actually skeletons the whole time' thing happens in Hell too. Who'da thunk.  

**2: The Trials of Doctor Hoffmann**

That's just not something you ever say. Particularly in a world where magic is very very real and quite often out to eat you.  

Speaking of which... giant monsters are always fun. The sense of scale is great.  

**3: The Hounds of Pluto**  

![Hellboy-2-3-It-did-not-turn-out-that-way](/embeds/books/attachments/hellboy-2-3-it-did-not-turn-out-that-way.png)  

Ah yup.  

 **4: Spanish Bride**  

One of my favorite storylines from Hellboy's life... when he got drunk in Mexico and ended up married to some nasty beasty.

 **5: For Whom the Bell Tolls**

And so it ends.  

Who knows what's next for Hellboy, if anything. (I'm sure someone knows, I haven't gone looking). That was quite a story and an excellent to comics in general and [comixology unlimited](https://www.comixology.com/) in particular. That's a wonderful art form and has a rather different feel than traditional novels and audiobooks, which I appreciate.  

Well worth the read.
