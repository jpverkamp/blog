Well that's a crazy story. In one part you have a battle with an undersea witch who is trying to save the world from the Hellboy prophesy, twisting wishes to kill people, getting saved by (essentially) the OG Little Mermaid (she wants to be foam on a wave).  

In another, you have a bunch of cool African mythology I'd never heard of:

I need to start collecting and reading mythology. There's so much there to make stories out of. Speaking of awesome imagery? Chains made of a dead man's bones:

Also, worldbuilding on the main storyline. The Dragon. And why/what Hellboy's hand is. It's a nice mix of the one offs and bigger stories. It's starting to grow on me.
