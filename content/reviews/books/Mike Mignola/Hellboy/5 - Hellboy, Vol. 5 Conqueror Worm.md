> God damn Nazi-Frankenstein monkey! You **don't** know **when** to **quit!**

I love these books.

They're the perfect blend of hilarious and creepy.

And they do a good job of hinting at just _what is it_ that makes someone a person?

Plus, you have one of the craziest core ideas for a plotline yet. There are spectral entities out in that want to come down, but they need a body to do so. How, may you ask?

Yup.  

Also: Hellboy spends **a lot** of time falling and crashing through things. What in the world would it take to actually kill him?
