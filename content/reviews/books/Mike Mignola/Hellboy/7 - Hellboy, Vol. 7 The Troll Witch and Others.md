This is most a collection of short stories, with little impact on the larger universe. The stories are still wonderful and creepy though.  

A creepy beasty that comes from a woman with her head kicked off:

This weird floating baby:

One thing that I really love about comic books is the 'sound words' (is there a better term for that?).

DIE! DIE! THUD THUD THUD  

Wonderful.  

I'm backdating these reviews a bit, but I think we've seen this before. And we'll certainly see it again.

Over and over we have cases of Hellboy carrying on a conversation with people and then **surprise** they were dead the whole time. Is it really happening? Is it all in his head? Is it a power he has and doesn't know about? Does he know? He never seems to react to it.  

I DON'T KNOW!  

It's still a bit of a surprise each time though...
