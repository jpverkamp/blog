It's the end?! (until {{< goodreads book="Hellboy in Hell, Vol. 1: The Descent" >}} at least!)

Crazy story.  

Mab's dead. A battle with a hedgehog turned badass warrior by Mab's blood.  

The noble dead riseâ€”but only the noble dead. Hellboy turns away from his destiny, but maybe it wasn't his after all.  

He gives up {{< goodreads book="Towers of Midnight" text="half the light of the world to save the world" >}} (Odin) and gets a giant hammer (Thor).  

Crazy times.

I'm sad it's over--but it's not really over. Of course **Hell** boy is going to have stories in the afterlife...  

Onwards to... {{< goodreads book="Hellboy in Mexico" >}}?
