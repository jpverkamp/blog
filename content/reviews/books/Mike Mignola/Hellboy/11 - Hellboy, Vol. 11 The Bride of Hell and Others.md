Another collection of shorts.  

**Hellboy in Mexico:**

All righty then! It's a pretty cool story, fun to see a new theme. A bit confusing where there's an entire collection named the same: [[Hellboy in Mexico]]()  

 **The House:**

That's a cool story. Hellboy is not one to try to sacrifice...  

 **The House of Sobek:**

A house theme? Sure! And good advice!  

 **Vampire Story:**

Not quite what I expected but nicely creepy.  

 **Bride of Hell:** Feels like we've done this one before?  

 **The Whittier Legacy:**

I love it.  

**Buster Oakley Gets His Wish:**

> “Moooooooooooo”  

This story is just truly bizarre, but in a good way.

I'm surprised to say this is probably my favorite of the Hellboy shorts yet. It's just so surreal compared to a lot of them--and that's saying something.
