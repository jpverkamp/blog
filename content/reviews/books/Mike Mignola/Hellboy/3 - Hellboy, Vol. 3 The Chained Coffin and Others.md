Well that was a weird tonal shift. After two books[^firsttwo] chock full of Nazis and demonic imagery and larger worldbuilding, {{< goodreads book="Hellboy, Vol. 3: The Chained Coffin and Others" >}} basically feels like a number of short stories all told in the Hellboy universe.

That's not to say they aren't weird and wonderful:

And we do at least have _some_ continuation of the main story:

But it's just weird.  

One neat thing was to see the talking body that plays a major role in the [2004 Hellboy film](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167190/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2). I remember that being bizarre and fun to watch.

Cool to see it's origin.  

Overall, I didn't enjoy it as much as the first, but I still enjoyed it a heck of a bunch.
