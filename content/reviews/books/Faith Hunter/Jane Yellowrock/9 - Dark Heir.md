title: Dark Heir
---
> My eyes latched onto his black ones, his desiccated lips moving. Shock thrummed through me like the single tone of a large bell, recently struck, vibrating, a pounding pulse of surprise. As the vibrations hit me, I realized that the pulse wasn’t just shock, but was part of the word I’d been hearing. Joses Bar-Judas was speaking that word. That wyrd. A spell of darkness encoded into a single word, the power released when it was spoken.

And so we're introduced to a *really* old big bad. 

It's interesting in books like these when you have relatively 'normal' points of view mixed in with characters that are literally centuries/millennia old. 

<!--more-->

*Dark Heir* does that well enough, by mostly completely ignoring the problem. For the most part, Joses is a monster. He doesn't talk (much? at all?). He wantonly murders humans, vampires, and anything else he can get hold of. And just about everyone wants him contained--albeit in various ways and numbers of pieces. 

So of course this is where Jane gets involved. 

Of course things have to go badly and explode in a number of spectacular ways. 

Upside: so much action. And a clear bad guy makes that much more straight forward than often, even if politics are want to get in the way. 

Downside: Jane seems to feel responsible for everyone. Seriously, it's *okay* to depend on people. Really. 

Upside: The Younger brothers. I'm glad to have a constant presence in these books that's human, (more than) competent, and not a love interest for Jane. It's grounding--and the books need that. 

Downside: We continue to get more and more off the rails with powerscaling Jane. I don't really know where in the world that's going--and I actually like that part. But screwing with time is a *powerful* ability, no matter how (little) you try to tone it down. We shall see. 

Upside:

I'm so glad that Bruiser is working out. 

> Bruiser was my . . . something. Boyfriend was too high school, lover was too sex-specific, significant other seemed more long-term and stable than what we might be starting to have. So my something was the best I could do.

The love tangle was a mess. I'm okay with weird confusion, so long as it seems to be going somewhere. 

Downside: Less beast.

> I am Beast. Beast is not prey.
> 
> You tell ’em, baby.
> 
> Am not kit.
> 
> I meant— Never mind.

Still a delight what we get. :smile:

Overall, an excellent book and I'm ready for the next one! Onward!
