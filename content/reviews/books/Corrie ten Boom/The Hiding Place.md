{{< goodreads book="The Hiding Place" >}} is an interesting book. In a nutshell, it's the most historical account of Corrie ten Boom--a older, unmarried devoutly Christian woman who lived in Holland before, during, and a bit after World War II. It tells the story of how she became the center of one group hiding and getting Jews out of the city and eventually paid the price for it.  

It's (unfortunately) not a story we haven't heard before, but I don't think I've ever read one from the perspective of a devout Christian. It's interesting to see how her religion drives her decisions, giving her the strength and hope to overcome all manner of problems throughout her life.

In particular, it's an interesting (at times intentional, at times not) look into the idea that God puts us in terrible situations in order to make us better people, that 'God has a plan for us all'.

It's... hard to see how she believes that all through. Seeing being stripped before the prison guards as an echo of Jesus naked on the cross? Thanking God for fleas because it means they wouldn't be caught praying by the guards? I see where they (and countless others are coming from). But as always, my thought really is: couldn't God do better?  

Overall, it's an interesting read from a historical perspective and I expect would be an even stronger read if you were devoutly Christian.
