{{< goodreads book="Jade War" >}} is the followup to the excellent {{< goodreads book="Jade City" >}}, dealing with the ongoing war between the clans (read: crime families) of Kekon, the stories of the Kaul family running it, and expanding into a number of other nations and how they're dealing with the expansion of the Jade trade and the aforementioned war.

Overall, it's a pretty solid follow up, taking the relatively constrained world of Jade City and expanding just about everything. It's fascinating to see how all of our favorite characters grow and change, sometimes for better, sometimes for worse.  

It is interesting how a large part of the book is centered around Anden in Espenia. Away from home, without Jade, but finding parts of his people are here as well. And finding love, or at least something that could be love one day.  

I think my biggest problem with the story is that in the end, despite deaths and conflict and hundreds of pages... nothing actually changed in the grand scheme of things. It's something of a problem for second books and it's not the worst thing that could happen, but it is more annoying when the third book ({{< goodreads book="Jade Legacy" >}}) isn't out yet. So it goes.  

Random note, this chapter title amused me to no end:  

> CHAPTER 41 Green as Fuck
