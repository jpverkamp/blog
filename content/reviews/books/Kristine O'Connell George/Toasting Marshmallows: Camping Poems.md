One of those 'read to the children over a few evenings, so I should count it' sort of books. 

> Warm front. Cold back.   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn around.  
> Warm back. Cold front.   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn around.  
>  
> I lean against Mom,  
> my head on her shoulder.  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warm all over.   

And it's actually a really fun book. The feeling of camping... in poetry form!
