Here in {{< goodreads book="The Boys, Volume 10: Butcher, Baker, Candlestick Maker" text=" The Boys, Volume 10: Butcher, Baker, Candlestick Maker " >}} , we learn about Becky, Butcher's wife and--really--the reason for many of the events of the series. Turns out she's absolutely wonderful and, no surprise to anyone, especially if you've seen the TV series  {{< spoiler >}}gets raped and eventually killed by a supe{{< /spoiler >}}  .

It's actually a pretty good story, giving a human element and motivation to Butcher that really does explain just why he's so crazy. I don't expect that we'll see the same twist that the series has... but then again  {{< spoiler >}}do we actually see the body?{{< /spoiler >}}  

Quite a story to start 2021 on...  

Onwards!
