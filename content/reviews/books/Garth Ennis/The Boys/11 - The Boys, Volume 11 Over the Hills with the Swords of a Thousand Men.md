*Spoiler: NSFW*   

Well holy crap. That's quite the penultimate story... we get a number of showdowns we've been looking for this entire time, between Butcher and Homelander and between the Boys and any number of supes. And we get one *hell* of a twist that I'll admit I didn't at all see coming. And like all the best of twists, it explains so much, while at the same time turning everything on it's heads.

For a climax to this particular story, it's quite a ride. Well done.  

Random thoughts (spoilers):

Dang that's a twist I didn't see coming. I really want to know if they'll go this same way in the series. I don't think so, since  {{< spoiler >}}Butcher's wife and son are alive and Homelander is directly involved with them{{< /spoiler >}}  . But it's possible.

Vic the Veep is such a cartoon. I would never have believed such a cartoonish idiot could become president, but ... well, you have the last four years. Yes. I went there. It's really a toss up which would have been / was worse. (/politics)

Oh Queen Maeves minions. So mindwashed. So amusing.  

![The-Boys-11-4](/embeds/books/attachments/the-boys-11-4.jpg)  

Well. That's quite the solution. Flying supes versus an army. It always seems to be the way--sheer numbers win the day.

Heh. That's pretty much Butcher in a nutshell.
