If {{< goodreads book="The Boys, Volume 8: Highland Laddie" >}} was a filler, {{< goodreads book="The Boys, Volume 9: The Big Ride" >}} is a return to form.  

Homelander is nuts. Butcher is nuts. Everyone is nuts. Hughie meets the old boss and gets some more backstory (wow this world is screwed up) and is back into the game.

It's fascinating to see how deep the world building goes. I am really looking forward to seeing just how everything explodes. I'm sure it won't be long now.  

Spoilers/pictures (*NSFW*):

So... Homelander is literally talking to himself, full on Gollum style now. That's not terrifying, not at all.

And... that dog. I love this scene.

So... how exactly are the Boys *not* superheroes in their own right. They're super strong and apparently have healing/extended life powers. They're supes too.  

Who watches the watchmen and all that.  

![The-Boys-9-4](/embeds/books/attachments/the-boys-9-4.jpg)  

That's a pretty crazy bit of backstory. They tried out supes in the war... and it went as badly as expected.  

![The-Boys-9-5](/embeds/books/attachments/the-boys-9-5.jpg)  

Nukes and supes. That's ... about right.  

![The-Boys-9-6](/embeds/books/attachments/the-boys-9-6.jpg)  

And that... that right there is the Spiderman quote of the day.
