Oy. Especially given what she's actually been through, which is I suppose the point. Just. Oy.  

Otherwise, this is primarily a bit of backstory on all of the Boys and a bit of the world, which is pretty interesting. Especially... Frenchie being French:

I enjoyed it.

Grusome of course. Bit off his nose. And it's funny because he can't talk anymore? Oy.

A bit more backstory on exactly what happened with the Brooklyn Bridge. We had a similar plotline in the TV series, but I like how they did it this way better. A bit more direct:
