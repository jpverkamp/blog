I recently watched [ The Boys ](https://www.amazon.com/The-Boys- Season-1/dp/B07QNJCXZK) on Amazon. It takes the basic idea that if you give a number of average people supernatural powers, a good number of them are going to call all sorts of wrong--even the good guys. So if the good guys are bad, [ who watches them? ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quis_custodiet_ipsos_custodes%3F)  

And--before it was a TV show, it was a graphical novel! One absolutely chock full of the same schocking language (  {{< spoiler >}}Butcher to his dog: fuck 'em{{< /spoiler >}}  ), violence (slightly less), and sexual content (much earlier) as the show.  

<!--more-->

For the most part, they're both good--in the actually terrible sense of the word--but for now I prefer the show. The book feels like it tries to cram in too much too quickly. Almost two full seasons in a single volume. Curious to see what happens though.  

How otherwise does it compare? (Potential spoilers, but I tried to avoid them).

I miss the show Huey. He felt more like an everyman in over his head. This one is more of a conspiracy nut.

A point on super powered individuals.

Homelander works, but Annie, I liked a lot better from the show. I think I missed that her name was Annie January. Weird surname.

That's a neat bit of worldbuilding. They don't really explain what happened, but it shows just how screwed up the world has gotten--and people just have to go on living with it.

Oh Annie. So innocent and in for such a rough time.  {{< spoiler >}}In the show it's only the Deep who forces himself on Annie; in the graphic novel, it's several of them, including Homelander.{{< /spoiler >}}  Again, I think I like the show better here. It's more a slow burn, making each of the characters broken and terrible in their own right.

One of the things that was pushed back and changed in the show. Compound V is still there and similar, but I'm not sure I like how they've done it in the book.  {{< spoiler >}}Giving the Boys the ability to go hand to hand with supes ... kind of defeats the point.{{< /spoiler >}}  

![The-Boys-1-07](/embeds/books/attachments/the-boys-1-07.jpg)  

Oh Butcher. To some extent, he's not that wrong about Americans in general. But it's quite a way to say it. And people are people no matter where you are.  

![The-Boys-1-08](/embeds/books/attachments/the-boys-1-08.jpg)  

Oy. And people close their eyes to it I bet.  

I am still curious where it goes from here though!
