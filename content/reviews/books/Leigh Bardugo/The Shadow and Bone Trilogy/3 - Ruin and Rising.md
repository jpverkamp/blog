Oh that's quite an ending. After [[Shadow and Bone]]() set the stage and [[Siege and Storm]]() raised the stakes, Ruin and Rising really brings everything home. 

We have the increasing religious fever of Alina as Saint--whether or not that's what she wants. 

We have what's left of Alina's friends and allies trying desperately to hold off the ever more powerful--and ever more unhinged--Darkling. 

We finally get some real history, digging deeper into where the Darkling came from... and perhaps how Alina fits into it all as well. 

We have more adventures; a desperate bid to find the third Amplifier that may well save the day--or doom them all. 

And finally--obvious seeing as it's the final novel in the trilogy--we have victory. But at what cost. 

It's by a decent margin my favorite of the three. A solid conclusion, in my opinion. Now I'm looking forward to the other series in the same world. Six of Crows especially to see where those threads in [[Shadow and Bone: Season 1|the show]]() came from and King of Scars for a 'what comes next'. Onward!

Things I particularly liked:

* Nikolai. He's just a lot of fun--and by the end gets quite the arc. 

* The Darkling. With what we learn of his childhood and the effects of a *very* long life--it all makes sense. And I feel for him. He's still totally the villain of the piece and needs to lose though. 

    > “In this moment he was just a boy -brilliant, blessed with too much power, burdened by eternity.” 

* Genya and David. They're my favorites. 

    > "*Na razrusha'ya.* I am not ruined. *E'ya razrushost*. I am ruination.” 

    and

    > “Beauty was your armor. Fragile stuff, all show. But what's inside you? That's steel. It's brave and unbreakable. And it doesn't need fixing.” 

* Mal. He's better. I wish Alina would just accept him as he is (and Mal would accept her as she is for that matter). But he's better at least. 

Things I didn't:

* {{<spoiler>}}Happy endings that cheapen the big sacrifice. For that matter; having to give it all up at the end... for reasons?{{</spoiler>}}

* The love mess. The Darkling never really worked, but otherwise I could see either path working out in the long run. But not *both*. I get it's a common YA *thing*, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. :smile:
