I tried. Really I did. But when you read as quickly as I do and realize that you've already spent more than a month on one book, it's time to move on.  

I think most of my frustration with this book comes from the fact that Pendragon is a teenager and acts like it. He is hit in the face with a world where humanoid cats are the dominant species and humans are little more than animals and just _cannot get it through his head_. Over and over, he expects the world to work one way, despite all evidence to the contrary.

Perhaps someday I'll give the series another try.  

Perhaps not.  

So it goes.
