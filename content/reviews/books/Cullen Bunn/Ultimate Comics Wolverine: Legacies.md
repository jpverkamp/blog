Cool. 

Jimmy gets a hidden message in that hidden message with his father. 

Enough to reveal a tiny bit of Wolverine’s past, how Jimmy came to be (almost graphically), and who his mother/family is…

Why does everyone have to be related?

As a one off, meh. In the greater storyline, too late. 

Skip-able, unless you’re going for completion.
