First one not on comiXology unlimited. Worth it.  

Man this one was crazy. Everything is changed, a pile of major and minor characters that we'd been getting to know are dead, the parents are separated (minor spoiler, but it really comes down to the how that's the big part; I didn't see that coming).

Oh, and the adorable little girl is growing up:

Plus, she's basically a wrestler. Whatever it takes to provide for your family, yes? Well... that's sort of the question, now isn't it?  

My favorite individual panel of this volume:

It loses a bit without having read who that is and what he's doing, but seeing the parallels between his story, the baby's (that's a baby on his chest), and Hazel's? Oh it's interesting.
