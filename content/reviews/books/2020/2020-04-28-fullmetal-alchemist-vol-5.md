WOMP. That is all. Oh this series sometimes.

I wonder if I would have thought they were so young if I had read this book a decade and multiple children of my own ago?

Eh? 200 days is only 6.5 months. They never really explain that one. It's an interesting point. There's always something complicated about straight up making life.

Oh Granny's got a rep.  

**5.20: The Terror of Teacher**  

Teacher! I remember thinking this section was pretty cool in the show.  

 **5.21: The Brothers' Secret**
