{{< goodreads book="A Little House Picture Book Treasury: Six Stories of Life on the Prairie" cover="true" >}}

Vastly simplified stories from the Little House books, with beautiful, colorful illustrations that really draw children's attention as you read it.  

At this point, we've listened to all of the full Little House books... who knows how many times. But there's always room for a shorter read when you just want to pick up a book for an afternoon read or in bed. And once the kids are reading on their own, I'm sure they'll appreciate it all the more.
