{{< goodreads book="Fairest, Volume 4: Of Men and Mice" >}}. In which one of the mice on that fateful night of glass slippers and dancing and pumpkin carriages ... never turned back into a man. And fathered thousands of half mouse, half human (in various configurations) offspring, which are now coming back to ruin Fabletown's lives.

It's a pretty neat story, if a bit bizarre at times. Plus, you get the standard craziness of the Fairy Godmother :D.

Fun times.  

I enjoyed this story and have mostly been enjoying this spinoff in general. Onwards and almost donewards!
