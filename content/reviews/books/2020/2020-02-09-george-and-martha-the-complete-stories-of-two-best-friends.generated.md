{{< goodreads book="George and Martha: The Complete Stories of Two Best Friends" cover="true" >}}

Another collection. These are bizarre little stories.  

In one case, the moral is lying to others is bad; in many others, they do exactly that to get out of various situations.

On top of that, several just end abruptly.  

Weird and not really worth re-reading in my opinion. But the kids currently seem to love them. So weâ€™ll see.
