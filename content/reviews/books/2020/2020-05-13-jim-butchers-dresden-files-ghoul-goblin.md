{{< goodreads book="Jim Butcher's Dresden Files: Ghoul Goblin" cover="true" >}}

{{< goodreads book="Jim Butcher's Dresden Files Welcome to the Jungle" text="Welcome to the Jungle" >}} was new, but an introduction. {{< goodreads book="Jim Butcher's The Dresden Files: Storm Front, Volume 2: Maelstrom" >}} and {{< goodreads book="The Dresden Files: Fool Moon, Volume 2" >}} are adaptations of previous works I've read a number of times. But {{< goodreads book="Jim Butcher's Dresden Files: Ghoul Goblin" >}}? NEW CONTENT!  

It's interesting seeing introductions over and over again. I know the books do the same, but for some reason it feels different in a comic. Perhaps because I'm reading them relatively quickly?

Dresden!

Well, nothing's on fire?  

Bob!

I enjoy Bob.

There's something of an irony here, especially since I'm right around {{< goodreads book="Changes" >}} in the main series. Ghoul Goblin was published 3 years after Changes, but takes place several books before.

It's a concept Dresden has made a number of times... but the wording just feels wrong. Too 'fancy' for Dresden. It stuck out.  

It is interesting to see more about both ghouls and goblins. We have seen both in the mainline series (although goblins don't really figure in much until some in {{< goodreads book="Changes" >}} and more in {{< goodreads book="Skin Game" >}}), but it was an interesting concept.  

Overall, I think Dresden in the comic format Just Works(tm) and I'm glad to see it. It's not quite as deep as a novel, but I'll not say no to having both!
