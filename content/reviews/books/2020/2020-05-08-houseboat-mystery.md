{{< goodreads book="Houseboat Mystery" cover="true" >}}

A mystery on a houseboat? Sure! That actually sounds like a really fun vacation.  

Grandfather's still just throwing his money around (what does he even do for work anyways?) and the kids are impressively meddlesome. But you know what? It works.  

<!--more-->

The idea that the entire mystery revolves around someone who happens to have a key to the houseboat and they happen to hide something on it, rather than just running, and no one talks to anyone else... It's a really thin plot. But it works, barely.
