{{< goodreads book="Frog and Toad Storybook Treasury: 4 Complete Stories in 1 Volume!" text="Frog and Toad" >}} are wonderful, full stop. It's a collection of collections, with 4 parts, each of which has a handful (5?) of short stories. You can read the individual stories or go through them all back to back (as I did over the last few nights). The stories are thematically related, but there's no real plot between them, so no reason to read them in any particular order.  

I think my favorite part of reading this is sharing just how wonderful the relationship between Frog and Toad is. They may argue sometimes, but they're always supportive in the end and really great friends. Also, I love doing voices. For me Toad ended up with a deep 'toadlike' voice and Frog somehow ended up being [Mouse from the Matrix](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/characters/nm0233391)... Who knows.
