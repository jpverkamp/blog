{{< goodreads book="A Little House Christmas Treasury: Festive Holiday Stories" cover="true" >}}

I’ve read or listened to the Little House books approximately a million times. The kids love them. This is basically a collection of the chapters from each book that cover Christmas. There’s a bit of context that feels like it’s missing without having just read the proceeding parts of the books, but if you’ve listened to them enough, it doesn’t overly matter.  

A bit weird to read in February, but kids are a bit weird to begin with. :D

Still a cute read and worth spending the time on. Perhaps it will go into the Christmas boxes for next year.
