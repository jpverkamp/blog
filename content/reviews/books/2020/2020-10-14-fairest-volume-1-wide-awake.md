{{< goodreads book="Fairest, Volume 1: Wide Awake" cover="true" >}}

Another day, another Fables subseries. In a nutshell, we have the Winter Queen (back again for the first time in a while) and Sleeping Beauty, both woken by 'true loves' kiss' gone all complicated, as things are wont to do.

All narrated by a fat little blue genie, who can't grant wishes so much as spew pop culture and real world references.

I know right?  

In any case, it's an interesting backstory to learn a bit more about Sleeping Beauty in this world (she's actually closer to her Fable than some) and see a bit of a redemption arc for the Winter Queen. I wonder how that will go on the longer run. Well worth the read though.  

On top of that, there's also a bit more information about Beauty and the Beasts' child. So that's what Totemkinder meant. Le twist!

Beast Noir? An interesting change in style.

Well that got quickly Cthulhian. For a fairy queen nonetheless. It's an interesting mix.
