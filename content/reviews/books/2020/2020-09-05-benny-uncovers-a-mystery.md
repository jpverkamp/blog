{{< goodreads book="Benny Uncovers a Mystery" cover="true" >}}

And so it ends--at least the original 19 books written by {{< goodreads author="Gertrude Chandler Warner" >}}, which is where I'll be stopping for the time being.  

And it's a rather strange story. Benny gets it in his head that he absolutely needs a summer job--so he ropes Henry into going with him... and the both of them end up working at the same place? With a mystery in the works to boot? Sure. It works.  

<!--more-->

The mystery this time around was a reverse shoplifter and mysterious woman hanging around--who was much less mysterious if you're expecting it, but my children at least were surprised. And it was worth reading at least to see the idea that sometimes people _don't like them because of their family name_. When it's not entirely uncommon to have Grandfather buy their way into or out of a mystery, it was something worth seeing.  

It was kind of a bummer to barely get any of Violet and Jessie, but so it goes. I do wonder if Warner knew this would be her last one. So it goes.  

Onwards to a new series for the children! Perhaps one day we'll return and try some of the later Boxcar Children mysteries.
