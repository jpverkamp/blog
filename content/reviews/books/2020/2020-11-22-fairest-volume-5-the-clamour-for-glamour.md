{{< goodreads book="Fairest, Volume 5: The Clamour for Glamour" cover="true" >}}

Of all the the ways for Fairest to end, Reynard knocking up a random mundie girl, a murder mystery among the non-human fables, and the final tale of Goldielocks was not where I expected it to go.  

It's a pretty good story though, all told. One of the best recent ones.

It's funny because fairy tales.  

![Fairest-5-2](/embeds/books/attachments/fairest-5-2.jpg)  

Suddenly fox baby. Don't worry, this can't possibly turn out badly.

Oh yeah, remember that? That was a long time ago. Poor Mary I guess.

Goldilocks is perhaps the strangest character in this series. I can't read sassenach without think of {{< goodreads book="Outlander" >}} though... Which kind of fits?
