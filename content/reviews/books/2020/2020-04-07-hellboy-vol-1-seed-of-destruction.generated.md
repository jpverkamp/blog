> If I have a real name, I've never known it. I'm called Hellboy.

I recently discovered [comiXology](https://www.comixology.com/) (mostly for reading {{< goodreads book="Fullmetal Alchemist, Vol. 1" >}}). Hellboy was one of the comiXology Unlimited suggested reads. Free trial? Let's do it.

I greatly enjoyed the movie [movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167190/) (the 2004 one, I haven't seen the [2019 one](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2274648/))... but as good as that was, the comic is better.  

It's got ACTION!

MYTHOLOGY!

Creepy tentacles!

And even touching moments.

It's a bit creepy and violent, so maybe not for you if that's not your thing. But if those are? Give it a go! I don't think you'll regret it.

Overall, graphic novels have a lot of potential for telling a different sort of stories than books, audiobooks, movies, or TV and I really should read more of them. This seems like an excellent place to start.
