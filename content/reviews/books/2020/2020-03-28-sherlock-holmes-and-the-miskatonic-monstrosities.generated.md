**Did not finish at 60%**  

I'm not actually sure what it is about the books. The writing is fine--it's overdone in a way that feels 'Holmesy' with a Cthulhian creepiness throughout --but I just can't get it to stick. And then about halfway, suddenly we have a few chapters of a flashback from entirely another set of characters, which I actually enjoyed reading more. But that's not the book I started to read.  

<!--more-->

Overall, the first book was a fascinating idea done well enough, but I don't think it really supported the sequel. So it goes. Feel free to give it a try, perhaps you'll like it more than I did.
