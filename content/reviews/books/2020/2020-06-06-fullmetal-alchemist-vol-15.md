{{< goodreads book="Fullmetal Alchemist, Vol. 15" cover="true" >}}

Herein, we see the horror of the Ishvalan war. Just how terrifying living weapons of war--taught that the Isvalans are the 'other' and deserve to die-- can be. Man this chapter hits hard.  

It's interesting to see the research {{< goodreads author="Hiromu Arakawa" >}} did for this book.

 **Chapter 58: The Footsteps of Ruin**  

For one: Al is so young to react that way to love.

For two, _definite_ {{< goodreads book="Elantris" >}} vibes... I'm curious tosee if I'm right about that.

Also, Mustang and Hawkeye's relationship makes so much more sense now.  

**Chapter 59: The Immoral Alchemist**  

Man so much background on the war. War sucks. War where one side has all the crazy weapons/magic... Man.  

Also:

Sad meta is sad.  

**Chapter 60: In the Absence of God**

Oh my.  

**Chapter 61: The Hero of Ishval**  

:( oh Hughes. Oh Mustang.

But hey, now we know why Scar can do what he can do (and only what he can do). I wonder if his brother somehow survived all that.
