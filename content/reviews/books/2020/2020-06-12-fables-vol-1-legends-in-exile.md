{{< goodreads book="Fables, Vol. 1: Legends in Exile" cover="true" >}}

Much like {{< goodreads book="Saga, Vol. 1" >}}, Fables has been on my list to read for the longest time. I have a soft spot for genre mashups, so the idea of taking Fairy Tales and having them alive and well in a hidden corner of our real world? Wonderful!  

{{< goodreads book="Fables, Vol. 1: Legends in Exile" >}} introduces us to the setting and the characters, taking the guise of a classic murder mystery and throwing a few Fairy Tale specific wrenches in along the way.  

<!--more-->

I love the art style--more traditional comic book style than Saga was, the characters--they're all the names you'd know and love, but often done in a much more gritty 'real' style, and I lvoe the story. The Fables have their own problems to deal with along with those in the real world.  

That being said, it is *not* a particularly child friendly story. Right from the beginning, it's chock full of adult language, nudity, and violence. It's a very adult take on what were once children's cautionary tales. You have been warned.  

Overall, it's a great introduction to a fascinating world. It looks like each volume has it's own internal story with an overarching plot across the entire series. I look forward to it!  

A few individual parts I loved for various reasons (here be minor spoilers!):  

![01-01-Once-upon-a-time](/embeds/books/attachments/01-01-once-upon-a-time.jpg)  

Once upon a time... Fables in New York. I think I fell in love with the idea in this very first frame.  

![01-02-Pinochio-problems](/embeds/books/attachments/01-02-pinochio-problems.jpg)  

Pinocchio problems... but more seriously, now we know that the Fables are more or less immortal and somewhat unchanging. And in some cases, that kind of sucks.  

![01-02-Snow-White-Director-of-Operations](/embeds/books/attachments/01-02-snow-white-director-of-operations.jpg)  

Snow White, Director of Operations. I love it.  

![01-03-NSFW](/embeds/books/attachments/01-03-nsfw.jpg)  

Ah, yup. Prince Charming is having sex with Mundys (this world's word for non- Fables).  

![01-04-Tardis](/embeds/books/attachments/01-04-tardis.jpg)  

So... basically the Tardis? I wonder if stories like that are in this world?  

![01-05-Murder-training](/embeds/books/attachments/01-05-murder-training.jpg)  

The Big Bad Wolf going by Bigby, being the town Sheriff, and Snow White basically learning how to be a murderer? A wonderful scene.  

![01-06-Jabberwocky](/embeds/books/attachments/01-06-jabberwocky.jpg)  

SNICKER SNACK!  

![01-07-The-Adversary](/embeds/books/attachments/01-07-the-adversary.jpg)  

What I was saying about the backstory. There's a *lot* of depth here, but nothing that we have to know about just yet. Just a reason the Fables are here and a plot to stretch across 20+ stories.  

![01-08-Dating-your-boss](/embeds/books/attachments/01-08-dating-your-boss.jpg)  

Oh man. Don't date your boss.  

![01-09-The-Parlor-Room-Scene](/embeds/books/attachments/01-09-the-parlor-room-scene.jpg)  

I do love the title cards for the chapters. A wonderfully dry sense of humor. Bluebeard (in the back) is one of my favorite characters, although I'm not yet sure if he's going to be a/the villain or get a redemption arc... Why not both!  

![01-10-Whodunit](/embeds/books/attachments/01-10-whodunit.jpg)  

Yup. It's a whodunit!  

![01-11-ROSE-RED](/embeds/books/attachments/01-11-rose-red.jpg)  

*le twist*  

I mean, once you saw what sort of tale this was, it was one of the obvious answers. But it's still pretty exciting.
