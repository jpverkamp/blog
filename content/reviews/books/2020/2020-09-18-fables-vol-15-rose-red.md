{{< goodreads book="Fables, Vol. 15: Rose Red" cover="true" >}}

Totenkinder (now Bellflower) has a plan, but she's not going to let anyone else in. So instead, we're going to deal with the fall of Rose Red after the death of Boy Blue and a shock from her past strong enough to shake her out of it.  

It's worth reading just for that, a bit of exploration into depression and loss from the framework of the Fables universe. And man has Red been through a lot--even before Boy Blue died.  

<!--more-->

Plus, a new baby* for Beast and Beauty! Because more plotlines are always worth while.

Hhe. Meta.

Oh man the dwarves are dark in this. No wonder Snow is a bit screwed up. And Red in turn.

Powers in this universe are yet another thing to deal with. Interesting enough --and quite a problem with how exactly do you deal with Mr. Dark--plus hints at just what will come to be in Fables 16!

That was sneaky. And easy. Too easy?

*Perfectly normal*. Uh huh.

Hmm. Cinderella is kind of a lot. A funny little story here though. A comic within a comic.
