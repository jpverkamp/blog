In the Boys Universe, there's a giant pile of superhero teams. There's the Seven of course, but also all manner of just as twisted other ones out there.

This time around, we have basically the equivalent of the X-Men: the G-Men/G-Force/G-Wiz/G-etc. All centered around a single Charles Xaviar alike with a somewhat more twisted background, who 'adopts' child superheroes and raises them to be on his team.
