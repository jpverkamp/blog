I do love the original Madeline story. It’s one I’ve read so much that I’ve memorized it, much to the confusion of the children whenever I decide to ‘read’ it without even holding the book.  

All of these other Madeline stories are new to me and while some of them get quite frankly rather weird and there are a number of rhymes that are rather a stretch... they’re still wonderful little stories to read.

A good bedtime book to read to/with children.
