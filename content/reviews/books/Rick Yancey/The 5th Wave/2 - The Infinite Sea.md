[[The 5th Wave]]() had an interesting premise with a lot of potential: alien spaceship shows up; 4 waves of death and destruction kill 99.99% of humanity. This is the story of all that unfolding, plus what happens next. 

The Infinite Sea takes that... and continues it? 

<!--more-->

Unfortunately, by continuing on from everyone already being dead, you're losing out on what really worked (for me) in The 5th Wave: the tension of the end of times. Now times have ended. And while there are still all manner of ways our protagonists could end up dead--we all know that they won't? At least most of them are going to survive.

Likewise, the my favorite point of view from the first book (Cassie) is much weaker in this one. She's no longer living through the end of the world, surviving what came next, and managing to find her brother. Now... she's far more YA protagonist, jealous and worried about 

On the other hand, Ringer. We didn't get as much of her in the first book and she really saves the second for me. For one, *things actually happen to/with her*. We actually get a bit more of 'alien' going on there. Even if perhaps not everything is as it seems...

I suppose I might as well finish the series now. But really, the first book stands decently alone.
