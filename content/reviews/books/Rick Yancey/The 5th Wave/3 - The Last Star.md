> It's always been this way... We bear the unbearable. We endure the unendurable. We do what must be done until we ourselves are undone.

Whelp. That's where [[The 5th Wave]]() ends. Honestly, the first book was really quite good. The second was fine. And the third was ... marginally better? 

But really, the ending kind of came out of left field, we got too much and not enough of the alien invaders all at the same time, and ... other than (mostly) Ringer, I don't particularly care about what happens next to any of the protagonists. 

So I suppose that is that. 

Onward!
