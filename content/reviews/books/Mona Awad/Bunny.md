Man, that is quite a book. 

It's part college experience--and not just any college experience, but one at a super small liberal arts school, focusing on writing and poetry and all that... to a degree that I (engineering school) couldn't even tell you for sure if it's satire or just *how that works*. 

It's part a story about loneliness and fitting in--which ties in well with the college experience. About seeing the 'popular girls', first from the outside, and then all too intimately. 

And of course (not that I knew this going into it; figured it out pretty quick though), it's part horror story. It's a slow burning thrilling, but there's more than a bit of the surreal and body horror bits of the genre. 

All together, it's an intense sort of read, sort of like a car crash, but in a good way. (Yeah. I know.)

It takes a while to get going, slowly getting more and more... off. And then everything skids hard to one side. You just can't look away. You have to see what happens next. 

Overall, I enjoyed the experience.

I think. 

Certainly not a book for everyone, but there are more than a few that I expect would get a (bunny?) kick out of it.

Side note: Add this to the list of books I don't *really* remember adding to my to read list... and ended up reading without looking re-looking up what they were about. 

It's certainly a surprise sometimes.
