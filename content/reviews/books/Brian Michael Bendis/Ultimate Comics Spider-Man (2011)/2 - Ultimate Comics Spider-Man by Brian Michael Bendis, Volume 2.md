Miles coming into his own.

Old enemies are **thrilled** to have Spider-Man back. Wisecracks and all. 

New ones? More of a mixed bag. I’m enjoying this Prowler even more than the Intro the Spider-Verse version. 

Onward!

It’s certainly something for business. I think he’s just way too low level for Fury to care about at the moment.
