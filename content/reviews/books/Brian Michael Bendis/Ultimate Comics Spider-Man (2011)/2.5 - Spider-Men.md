Now we have TWO Spider-Men. 

Itâ€™s another part of what became Into the Spider-Verse, with another Peter Parker getting shot across dimensions and meeting Miles. 

Itâ€™s good fun all around. Iâ€™m glad to see the two get a chance to meet. And Iâ€™m going to have to check out some main universe Spider-Man at some point!

And I do wonderâ€¦ whatâ€™s Fury going to do now that he knows about parallel realitiesâ€¦ or apparently what Stark might do. 

Onward!

I did not expect this scene.

Thatâ€™s hilarious. And given my background is the MCU, the Ultimate universe, and mostly bits and pieces otherwiseâ€¦ I didnâ€™t actually know that.
