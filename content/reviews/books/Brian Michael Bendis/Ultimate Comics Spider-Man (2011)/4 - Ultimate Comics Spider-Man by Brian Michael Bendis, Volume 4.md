title: Ultimate Comics Spider-Man by Brian Michael Bendis, Volume 4
---
Miles is new on the job—and already too many people know (or suspect that he’s Spider-Man).

I do like this Jameson. 

Unfortunately, that list includes Venom. 

So now we’ve got to deal with the tragic origin part of Spider-Man stories. 

Oy.

It’s such a crazy story and I love seeing another Spider-Man I know less about. Hard to believe—in this run at least—we’re almost out of issues! 

I expect/hope he moves to the main Marvel universe and gets his own line. I think that’s a thing? 

Onward!
