Miles Morales!

I did not realize that he originally came from the Ultimates universe. So this is actually a new origin story!

Pretty cool. Itâ€™s interesting seeing what made it into Into the Spider-Verseâ€”and what didnâ€™t. 

I do wish weâ€™d had a chance to see Peter and Miles interact more, but I think this will work out. Itâ€™s got a lot of potential. 

Onward!

Of all the ways to get that lineâ€¦ at his funeral.

Thatâ€™s a twist that could go wellâ€¦ or terribly. Or both!

ðŸ˜† okay I didnâ€™t expect it to immediately go that way.

I did not consider how much it would freak out Spider-Manâ€™s villains.
