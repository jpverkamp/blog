My thoughts exactly. 

Issues 16 and 17 of Spider-Gwen are apparently a crossover with Spider-Man… so here we go?

Of course we go right from the above to “Miles’ dad is missing”, so I’m not entirely sure this is going to be a helpful aside for Spider-Gwen. We shall see!

… seriously?

I have no idea what's going on with that... but I'm going to leave that one for another day. 

Yeah… that’s a crazy dimension hopping story.

Things get weird. 

And eventually everyone goes home… more or less having saved the day?

I’m going to have to go read this Spider-Man series now aren’t I?
