title: Ultimate Comics Doomsday
---
It hasn‚Äôt been that long since Magneto and the Ultimatum wave killed millions. But apparently long enough. 

So now another threat is popping out of nowhere and wrecking just about everyone. Time for those left to save the day‚Ä¶ yet again. 

I always knew that Reed Richards was up to no good. Perhaps not intentionally, but that much brains combined with a seemingly complete inability to know when something is too much‚Ä¶ not a great combination. 

It‚Äôs fine. Not great. Not terrible. 

Onward.

Modern Zola is interesting. I expect even the ones I don‚Äôt recognize are Ultimate versions of various heroes? (And villains)

Not **entirely** wrong.
