A followup to {{<crosslink "Wolverine: Old Man Logan">}} and a quick stop in the Battleworlds that predate {{<crosslink "Secret Wars">}}.

It's a fascinating bit of story, with poor 'Old Man' Logan bouncing between a world (or two) where the X-Men live, a world where anyone not in Iron man armor contracts a techno virus, and a world of the dead. 

On the other hand, it doesn't really go anywhere--not until we get to Secret Wars itself. And after that, Old Man Logan ends up in the new combined world, back in our present. I expect that will go well.

Onward!
