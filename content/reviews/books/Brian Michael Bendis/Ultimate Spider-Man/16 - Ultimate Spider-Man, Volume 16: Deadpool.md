title: 'Ultimate Spider-Man, Volume 16: Deadpool'

Spider-Man and Kitty Pride are cute. So when Deadpool randomly shows up to kidnap the X-Men and take them back to Krakoa for that reality show huntâ€¦ Spider-Man ends up going along for the ride. 

A whole lot of action here, if little in the way of any overarching plot. Fun enough. 

Not a fan of this less ambiguous, straight up evil Deadpool. Weâ€™ll see if he comes back at some point though. 

Onward.

Mask vs Mask! And now we get to see what Ultimate Deadpool has going onâ€¦

Ew.

Costumes all tornâ€¦ strategically.

Edit: Apparently Morbius is part of this volume?

And then he Morbed all over. Or something like that?

Thatâ€™sâ€¦ a very strange corner of the Marvel universes. I donâ€™t know why vampires are weirder than anything else, but they are!

Plus, itâ€™s barely an introduction.
