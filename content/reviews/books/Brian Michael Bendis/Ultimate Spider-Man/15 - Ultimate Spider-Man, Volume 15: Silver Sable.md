title: 'Ultimate Spider-Man, Volume 15: Silver Sable'
---
In doing some good, Spider-Man has attracted some new friends. Silver Sable! Some bald man in a bird costume! (Vulture). Disgruntled ex-SHIELD folks. 

A good story. 

Peter’s life just keeps getting better, worse, and more complicated all at once. 

Onward.

That’s delightful.
