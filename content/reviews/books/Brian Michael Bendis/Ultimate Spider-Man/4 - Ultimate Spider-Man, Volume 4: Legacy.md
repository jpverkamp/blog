Osborn’s back and green with envy! Or maybe just green. 

But have no fear…

Nick Fury is on the case. 

That’s good, right?

The conflict between the Osborns, the anguish of Parker’s lives tearing him apart. It’s a solid story. 

The one bit left, I’m not sure what’s going on with the Gwen story line. Don’t do it Peter. Choose MJ!

Onward!

That’s a cute interaction.

I can perfectly imagine the timing on that. Go Harry!

That whole scene was bonkers and awesome. Especially seeing it first from Spider-Man’s point of view and then Osborn’s.
