Poor Spider-Man. School troubles, girl troubles, and super hero identify struggles.

Just can’t catch a break. 

It’s nice to have a relatively low level, human story—even if we still absolutely get changes that are going to ripple through the rest of the storyline. 

Onward!

I’m going to assume it’s the same Wasp as in the Ultimates. Good for Fury to send help!

Ironic, I’m sure intentionally, given Miles Morales. In Into the Spider-Verse, he’s definitely not white and if I remember correctly, totally spoke Spanish.
