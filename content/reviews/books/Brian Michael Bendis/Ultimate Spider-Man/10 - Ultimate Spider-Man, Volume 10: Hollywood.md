Oh my. That’s when we are. This has potential.

Oh yes. That is Toney McGwire and (this real) Spider-Man. 

The idea that Octavius is on the run again and that the film crews got it all—and made to use that as footage in the Sam Raimi Spider-Man film? Oh that’s hilarious. 

Plus a few more reveals and a bit more with Peter’s classmates. Always good to have. 

A good one. 

Onward.

Not until 2011! (Five years from now). I wonder how far down the pipeline Miles Morales already was then.

That’s a weird dynamic. Weirder now. 

I like it.
