Woo boy that was a ride. I was expecting some fallout from Gwen… but all we get on that front was a single line. Kinda weird. 

Instead, a body swap story with Wolverine (hilarious), getting to meet Johnny Storm who is just trying to be normal (best Fantastic Four story thus far!), and a dreamy (but in the nightmare sort of way) introduction to Doctor Strange. 

All that in six issues/a single volume. 

Good, but Oy the whiplash. 

Onward!

Notes. Spoilers. 

The introduction:

Delightful.

… that’s wonderful. Not entirely fair to Parker. But greatly amusing.

Back in his body, back to bullying and other high school drama.

I expect Liz is regretting this now.

That’s cute.

**And** a slightly different take on Doctor Strange? Quite the volume.
