Such a teenager sometimes. Too broke for a new costume. Caught passing notes in class. Some guy my things up. The X-Men. You know.

I love it. Itâ€™s relatively lower stakes. Gives Peter and MJ some time to breathe. Builds the conflict between Peter in school and as Spider-Man. 

Plus, funny foreign accent guy is amusing and we get an X-Men crossover. 

A good one. 

Onwards!

Thatâ€™s cute.

1. Telepath downsides, yo. 
2. Donâ€™t think of pink elephants!
3. How you dress does not justify rape. But that all comes down to not acting on your first thoughts like a monster. But given her outfitâ€¦ is it not surprising that is **not** peopleâ€™s first reaction?

The fact that this goes on for two pages though? Hilarious.

â€¦ angels?

I feel like thatâ€™s among the most ethical self inspection the Professor has done yetâ€¦
