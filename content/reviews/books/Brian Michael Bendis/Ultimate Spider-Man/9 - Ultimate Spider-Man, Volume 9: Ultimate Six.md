Huh. 

I expected some version of the Sinister Six, but to have it be an Ultimates/Spider-Man crossover? Pretty cool. 

There are some serious mental issues at play here and only mostly on the villains side. Likewise questionable choices. 

But the good guys all get to go home in the end, right?

Right?

Onward!

It’s not Samuel Jackson’s Fury… but I can hear him in these lines. That’s probably on me though.
