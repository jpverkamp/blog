Osborn(s)! Back again! After however long locked up in what’s proving to be not that be that secure at all, Norman is free and looking for his legacy. 

Action packed, with more moments with Spider-Man and Kitty. They’re cute. I hope the friends and allies think works out for them. I really do. 

Onward!
