title: 'Ultimate Spider-Man, Volume 6: Venom'
---
Well thatâ€™s another packed volume. A dash of memory on tape: Peterâ€™s father. Andâ€¦ apparently childhood friend Eddie Brock?

Of course one thing leads to another, they find the venom formula (SCIENCE this time, not alien; at least not that we know), and we very Venom suit Spider-Man. Only for a few moments and heâ€™s already done with that. 

Itâ€™s a bit quick to go from â€˜oh hey, childhood friend you forgotâ€™ to fighting Venom in the street, but I expect weâ€™ll see more of him. 

Plus, an aside with Fury! And references to the events of the Ultimates!

Onward!

A reference! Just a line, but Iâ€™ll take it.

A good rule. In comics, even if you **do** see the bodyâ€¦

So long as itâ€™s not Uncle Ben at least. He (apparently) **stays** dead. 

Wonder if thatâ€™s still true.

â€¦ that seems young for Fury. Perhaps I have Samuel Jackson in my headâ€¦ and perhaps heâ€™s the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. in his 30s?
