Well that was absolutely wild. Characters back from the dead! Carnage! A whole bunch of Spider-Men (-Women, -Abominations)! Secret government projects… that may or may not be SHIELD related! The Fantastic Four! X-Men! Fury! Ultimates!

I don’t know if any of this is something that’s happened before in Spider-Man story lines, but it’s certainly not one I’ve heard of before. Probably the biggest shake up I’ve had through the Ultimate Marvel read through. 

Well well worth the read!

Onward!

Not sure it really fits… but it does make him more terrifying.
