title: 'Ultimate Spider-Man, Volume 1: Power and Responsibility'
---
Peter Parker gets beat up at school; Parker goes in a field trip to Osborn’s lab; spider goes chomp; etc. It’s the standard Spider-Man origin, especially if you (like me) started with the Sam Raimu Spider-Man. 

But you have to start somewhere right? It’s a solid story, I like the art, and we’re setting up for something big. 

Onward!

Not quite great responsibility.

Science! Badly…

Heart of Spider gold!

Not quite the same words, but it’s got the same soul.

A little slow, but he gets it eventually. Sort of.
