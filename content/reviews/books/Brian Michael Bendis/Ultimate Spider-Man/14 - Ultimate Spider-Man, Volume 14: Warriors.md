Well thatâ€™s quite the cast. Hammerhead is apparently not dead and trying to elbow in on Fiskâ€™s territory. Enemy of my enemy â€¦ is actually still a pretty bad dude?

And of course Moon Knight, Iron Fist, Elektra, and Black Cat get involved. Oh thatâ€™s a busy few days in New York. 

A fun story.
