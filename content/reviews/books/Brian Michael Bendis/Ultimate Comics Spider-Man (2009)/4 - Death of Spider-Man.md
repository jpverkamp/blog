title: Death of Spider-Man
---
Death of Spider-Man. 

So. Is he finally going to hang up the mask for good? (again) A metaphorical sort of death? 

Or, given that it's the Ultimate Marvel Universe... is Peter Parker himself the next on chopping block? 

Oy. 

Of all the Ultimate Marvel titles, [[Ultimate Spider-Man]]() ({{<crosslink text="continued" title="Ultimate Comics Spider-Man (2009)">}}) has been by far the most consistently good. Often great. He's a good kid and consistently tries to do his best. 

Well worth the read.
