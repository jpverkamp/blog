I feel like we’ve [[Ultimatum: Requiem|been here before]]().

But this time around, as much as it is about endings… it’s also about new beginnings (see below, spoilers). Which is kind of a bummer. We really needed more time to breath and process, but this all feels like setting up whatever comes next. 

Still, I’m looking forward to it. 

Onward.
