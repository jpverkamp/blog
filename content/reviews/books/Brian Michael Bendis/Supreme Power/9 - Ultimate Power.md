Reed. Trying to do the right thing.

What can possibly go wrong? … this time. 

Nothing that a team of Fantastic Four, X-Men, Spider-Man, and some Ultimates couldn’t fix? What if you add in the Squadron Supreme? (Seriously, who names these things?)

It’s an action packed crossover with a team I didn’t even know existed, a lesson in hubris for a few I’m sure won’t learn it, and a peak into just who the most powerful in the Ultimate universe are. 

An interesting one off. 

Onward!

Delightful.

… Fury brought him. That’s dumb. Giving him literal Spider-Man reigns though? I don’t even know how to describe that one.
