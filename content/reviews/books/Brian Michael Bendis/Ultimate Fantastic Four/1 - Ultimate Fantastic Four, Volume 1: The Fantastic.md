Reed, Sue, Johnny. Ben back at school. The gangs all here!

I have to admit, but a branch of the Marvel Universe I’m that familiar with. Looking forward to finding out!

Of course the first thing that has to happen is the accident…

It’s a bit quick we don’t really get time to even know Reed Richards, let alone the rest of them. I expect they’ll get some time to breathe as the series goes on. 

Otherwise, it’s a weird mix of science and pseudo history. Pretty weird. 

So far, I like the X-Men and Spider-Man better. But we’ll see. 

Onward!

Well that’s certainly an odd one.
