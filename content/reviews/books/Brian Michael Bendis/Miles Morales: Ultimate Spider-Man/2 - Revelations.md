Resolution of the Parker storyline: check. Ish. I still don’t like it. 

Miles’ father back and a bit of backstory? Awesome. 

Kate Bishop’s secret? Also a nice* twist. 

*not actually nice. 

Goblin? Electro? Sabertooth? Hydra? Doom? Defeated!

It’s a jam packed volume, just at the right scale for Spider-Man. A good one.

Notes. Spoilers.

Then *why* did you bring him back?!

I’ll admit, I didn’t see that one coming. Mostly because Hydra has barely been a thing in the Ultimate universe. It has potential, I guess.

You know… it works. I like a Spider-Person Black Widow.
