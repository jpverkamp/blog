So… Peter Parker is back? And for now at least, they’re going to play it straight?

This is why comics have such a hard time with big, hard hitting stakes. It never ends up mattering… 

Perhaps they’ll figure out a satisfactory way around it in the next one?

Other than that, Miles is fun, relationship dramas and truth is part and parcel for Spider-Man, and the whole story with his father has some potential. 

We’ll just have to see!

Onward.

Is funny because it’s true. :)
