The one that starts digging into Logan’s issues. And oh does he have issues. 

Best part:

A good part of the story is Spider-Man and Wolverine teaming up. That’s just wonderful. I really enjoy the contrast.

And Daredevil! Even if not much. Good times. 

I like the longer stories that, while having some self contained parts, are really part of a larger story. In this case: who was Logan and where (when?) did he come from?

Onward!

Notes. Spoilers.

… yeah okay. Even with the wedding ring, I did not see that one coming. 

Even if a panel later she instead claims sister / mother / etc.

That’s mildly terrifying.

And that’s even more so. 

I’m not **entirely** sure she has this whole Phoenix thing as under control as she thinks.
