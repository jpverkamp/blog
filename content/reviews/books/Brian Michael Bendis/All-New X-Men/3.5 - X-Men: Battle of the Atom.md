Taking a quick side trip to another line of comics as things mix a bit. It’s kind of bonkers how in the world you’re supposed to keep track of everything with all of these crossovers. Which I suppose is the idea.

Anyways. 

Timey whimey madness ensues, we get a Back to the Future moment, the X-Men go home… who are we kidding. Of course things go weirder. 

Worth tracking down. Worth reading. 

Man  that was a ride.

A few pages that stuck out (minor spoilers):

That’s a wonderful introduction/catch up frame.

More X-Men! Oh my stars and garters. 

Best part? That’s totally Deadpool. 

Also, S.H.I.E.L.D. gets involved:

That’s not foreshadowing… is it? At this point who even knows.

I can’t not hear Ryan Reynolds. And… I’m okay with that.

I do love these interludes.
