As if time travel weren’t enough… now the new old X-Men happen to bump into a new new mutant with the power to send them to all sorts of different places and times. Oh boy.

Miles Morales. Dinosaurs in Antarctica. Another Kid Wolverine. Jeans Grey. MOLE MAN. Dr. Doom. This volume really has it all. 

I just wish they didn’t have a whole new set of problems when they can’t even deal with the whole out of time thing. That is going to get resolved… right?

Right?

Laura’s budding relationship is cute. As is Jean’s new outlook. I like seeing the characters grow.

And so it ends as it began. Ew. :)
