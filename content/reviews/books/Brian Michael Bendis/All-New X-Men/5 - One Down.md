Yup. Ya done screwed up Beast. 

Beast mopes. Jean mopes. The future future Brotherhood come back to the past/future. Shape shifters shift shapes. Everything is timey whimey and complicated. No one really learns anything. 

A time travel loop—keep trying until it works—is kind of overdone… But if you’re ever going to use it, this is the storyline. 

Oh comics. 

Onward.

Cool scenes and spoilers:

Okay. 

For now. 

You know, I actually like this older Scott well enough. He was painted as the villain but he’s not so bad.

Mystique has how many kids with how many X-Men bouncing around now? 

Speaking of which…
