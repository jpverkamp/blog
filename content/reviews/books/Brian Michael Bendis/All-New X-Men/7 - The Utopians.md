So we have a trainingish montage with Jean and Magik, two issues were saw already, and a big character moment for Bobby…

… which is cute way to do it I suppose. If it had any other impact.

And then there are mutants on Utopia.

These interludes are my favorite. 

But this subplot is over almost before it begins. So I suppose… for the last volume in the series… what was the point? I expected the X-Men to be able to go home, but that was never in the cards was it. We get some new faces in a new run? Perhaps I’ll read it eventually.
