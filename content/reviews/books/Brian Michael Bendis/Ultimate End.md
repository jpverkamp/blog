title: Ultimate End
---
And so the Ultimate Universe ends... with a weird confusing mess of a send off? 

It's sort of a companion to {{<crosslink "Secret Wars">}}, more specifically focusing on what is happening in the Earth-1610/Ultimate Universe part of the Battleworld... but it's not really necessary.

All you need to know is that this is the ... Ultimate End. 

(You really can skip this one, it's all right.)

It's kind of crazy that out of all the billions on Earth and who knows how untold many others around the universe... only Miles Morales (and I assume his friends and family) survived. 

He's cool though, so I guess it's all good?
