Another giant story; the second 'biggest' of the Ultimate Marvel Universe

Uh oh. Gah Lak Tus? Time to meet GALACTUS!

Iâ€™m sure this will go well. 

Being titled Cataclysmâ€”and the last in the Ultimate Marvel Universe lineâ€”after all. 

The X-Menâ€™s involvement? Meh. 

Spider-Man? Pretty awesome. Touching and  personal, even in the face of a giant purple guy with a fancy hat. 

The Ultimates: what is with that art style? Everyone getting infected with Galactus is amusing. Purple Hulk! 

The Ultimates Last Stand? The meat of the story. 

Reed Richard's redemption arc (of a sort)? What... he does not deserve that. 

Itâ€™s kind of a deus ex solution to an impossible problem. But thatâ€™s sort of the way with comics.

Or â€¦ maybe it is?

Side note:

> Collecting HUNGER #1-4, CATACLYSM #0.1, CATACLYSM: THE ULTIMATES' LAST STAND #1-5, CATACLYSM: ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN #1-3, CATACLYSM: ULTIMATE X-MEN #1-3, CATACLYSM: ULTIMATES #1-3 and SURVIVE!  

Oh comics. 

Makes reading events (like this) in the Marvel Unlimited app tricky. 

Reading notes. Spoilers.
