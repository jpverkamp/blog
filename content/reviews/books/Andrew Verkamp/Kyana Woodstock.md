> Suppose the proverbial "greatest book of all time" is The Bible (and/or the Quran?). These collections contain a series of sometimes random, rambling stories, yet they all reinforce a key overarching theme. Debates continue as to whether The Bible is pure fact—a series of "memoirs" documenting events around that central theme—or fictionalized to reinforce the same message.
> 
> Harry Potter, by many accounts, comes in second as one of the greatest books ever written. There’s no debate about this one; it was crafted purely as a work of fiction. But again, it’s a series of stories that follow close friends as they navigate their life journeys.

That ... is quite a book.

On one hand, it's a memior of Andrew Verkamp--a boy who ~grew~ threw up in rural southern Indiana. And to read it, it's honestly a bit of a surprise he made it this far. From a runaway chainsaw to a cabin in the woods, from childhood drinking to biting a head off a turkey. And that's just the beginning.

I don't know how many of these stories will translate well if you didn't grow up in that particular time and place, but at the very least it's just like a train crash--in all the best ways. You know, for some reason, that you perhaps shouldn't be enjoying this quite so much--but it's hard to look away. 

> EDITOR'S NOTE: I assume any legal implications from that evening have long since exceeded the statute of limitations, and this public confession has no legal basis. If it does, just forget I said anything. It was a snowy night, and obviously, I was safe at home cuddled up in bed that night (just ask Mom and Dad). That's the story, and I am sticking to it.

On the other, it's the story of Kyana Woodstock--25 years of a local mirror of that famous concert now itself more than half a century gone. Growing from a TV in the backyard to a 30'+ screen, hundreds of guests, live music, and entirely too many fireworks to a professional venue with licensing fees, insurance worries, and seats for 1500. 

It's structurally a strange book, taking half the time to even get to the title's point. It's a touch 'stream of consciousness' at times and you're never quite sure where (or when) the next story is going to take you. 

> This isn't your average blah, blah, blah book. Instead, it's a random "kamikaze" style of seemingly unrelated "pukes" of brain thoughts, all weaving into a 'sorta' seamless collection of recollections. Four books in one.

But oh, is it a ride alone the way. 

Disclaimer: You might be able to guess from author's name (and the fact that I'm *in the book*) that this is my father. I also helped a bit to edit the book and read an earlier version before this one. Heck, I even wrote one of the chapters (apparently). So take this all with a ~grain~ heaping spoonful of salt. But like I said--once you get start, it's a hard book to put down.
