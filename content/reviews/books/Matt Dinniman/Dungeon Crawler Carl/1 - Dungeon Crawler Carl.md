> Goddammit Donut!

This book has no right to be quite so fun as it is. Billions of people die in the first chapter, it’s full of blood and gore and formerly-living-detritus, and the entire thing feels like a video game—menus, inventory, levels, and loot boxes included.

> New achievement! You’ve killed an armed mob with your bare fucking hands! Holy crap, dude. That’s kinda fucked up. Reward: You’ve received a Bronze Weapon Box!

Oh, also, the language is… not exactly SFW. You have been warned. (Believe it or not, it gets worse than that.)

And yet, it’s also kind of hilarious. And just sort of grabs on to you and doesn’t give you the chance to let go. With just enough behind-the-scenes mysteries to keep you interested.

> Bad Llama. Level 3. It’s a llama, but it’s bad. If he were human, he’d be covered in prison tattoos and would be hanging out in front of the Circle K hitting on 14-year-old girls. They might be willing to sell you something if you have good stuff to trade. You won’t want to get hit by their spit.

Carl is great. Princess Donut is great.

> Cats are assholes. I get it. But do you know why people like cats, despite their asshole-ness? It’s because they don’t fucking talk.

But it’s really the dynamic between the two at the heart of the story. Oh how much I’m rooting for the two of them…

I’ve no idea how long this series is going to work. Eventually, you have to finish the dungeon, no? Or run out of video game tropes and one liners?

Well, for me at least, we’re not there yet. Onward!

Side note: I’d been recommended the audiobooks for these and I’m so glad I’m listening to them. I’m sure the text version is funny as well, but the voice work in this really is top notch and I think cranks up the book another level. Give it a try!
