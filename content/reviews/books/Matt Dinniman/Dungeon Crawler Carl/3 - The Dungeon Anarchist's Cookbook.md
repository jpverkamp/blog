title: The Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook

> I liked Bautista, I thought as I finished building my train bomb, but his Tigran race made him look like a tiger that had been vomited upon by a Lisa Frank notebook. I didn’t know how anything could embarrass him.

Oh, that's another fun one. 

Two major things that stand out:

* The titular Dungeon [[wiki:Anarchist Cookbook|Anarchist's Cookbook]](). That's a fun idea already and I'm just waiting to see what more can be done with it. 
* The floor of the dungeon we spend most of the time on--trains. All the trains in a chaotic snarl. Delightful. 

And the stakes just keep rising (which, all things considered, is impressive).

Onward!
