He just keeps going. More chaos, more levels, more *caring* for this absolutely *ridiculous* setup and what is going to end up to happen to Carl and Princess Donut and all their friends/enemies/fans/decapitated sex doll heads. 

Aaaaaah!

> Trauma does that, I thought. It’s an explosion with your heart at the center. It changes everything all at once. 

So much happens in this book. 

The Hunting Grounds. 'Hunters' from the rest of the universe, given spots to hunt the crawlers. 

The fan convention. Which goes about as well as you'd guess. 

The lawyers. Finally getting involved (that wasn't even supposed to be seen until a few floors from now). 

The politics. Oh the wide world of politics. 

Dinosaurs.

Vampires.

Vampire dinosaurs. 

About a million praying mantis aliens. 

Misdirections and tricks and breaking the rules. 

And that's not even the half of it. 

> She looked up at me. “Viva la revolución, Carl.”

I have absolutely no idea what to expect in the next book...

And given that epilogue? I don't think the dungeon or the universe does either. 

Onward!
