> Now, if you’ve never had a flaming, skull-faced bear on roller skates barreling at you full speed, you don’t know what you’re missing.

And so Carl and Princess Donut descend to the third floor. With a choice of race (of course Donut will choose Cat, was there ever any doubt?) and class. 

> NecroBard This unusual class combines one of the most-loved occupations with one of the most reviled.

Right. 

Things are going to get worse (of course) even as they get better (or at least higher level). And now, we're getting the first hints of life in teh rest of the universe--outside of the Dungeon!

> “If that’s true,” I said, “then you’re all in that same pot.” I turned to look at the audience. “All of you. If a government is afraid of what its people say, then maybe there’s a reason for it.” 

Politics, yo. 

I'm fully expecting more of that as the series goes on!

Overall, a worthy successor to the first one and I'm still interested to see where in the *world* this series can even go from here. 

Onward!
