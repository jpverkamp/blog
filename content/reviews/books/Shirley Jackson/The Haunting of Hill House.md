> No live organism can continue for long to exist sanely under conditions of absolute reality; even larks and katydids are supposed, by some, to dream. Hill House, not sane, stood by itself against its hills, holding darkness within; it had stood so for eighty years and might stand for eighty more. Within, walls continued upright, bricks met neatly, floors were firm, and doors were sensibly shut; silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House, and whatever walked there, walked alone.

A haunted house? Let's do SCIENCE!

Well, that's the claim. Mostly, it's a vehicle to get all our main characters in one place, plus a bit of conflict later on. 

Other than that, we have character introductions. They're some weird folks--the best kind for these stories. And then the house as character. It's impressive how you can get such a feel for a place with only minimal (initial) description. And then the caretakers of the house. Quite the characters those two are. 

And then... things get creepy. There's little jumping out of the page to scare you. It's not that sort of story. But it's creepy nevertheless. Perfecting that evermounting sense of dread. And at that, it's quite well done. 

I think that I enjoyed this book more having listened to the audiobook. It's a slow burn and... hard to describe just why it's so intriguing? 

Worth a try. 

> Journeys end in lovers meeting; I have spent an all but sleepless night, I have told lies and made a fool of myself, and the very air tastes like wine. I have been frightened half out of my foolish wits, but I have somehow earned this joy; I have been waiting for it for so long.
