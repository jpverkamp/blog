There's a reason that many people who suggesting a starting point for Discworld suggest people start with the City Watch subseries and _Guards! Guards!_ in particular. It's hilarious.  

> They may be called the Palace Guard, the City Guard, or the Patrol. Whatever the name, their purpose in any work of heroic fantasy is identical: it is, round about Chapter Three (or ten minutes into the film) to rush into the room, attack the hero one at a time, and be slaughtered. No one ever asks them if they want to. This book is dedicated to those fine men.

In a nutshell, the Night Watch of Ankh-Morpork are badly understaffed and only a shadow of what they once were. Then Carrot arrives. A human orphan raised by Dwarves with a sense of how things ought to be a mile wide. And then a book is stolen. And a dragon is summoned. Things go from bad to worse. Hilarity ensues.  

It's a wonderful book. A good place to start Discworld. I'm really curious where we'll go from here.
