Interesting Times is a fantastic Discworld novel, an excellent example of everything people expect when they talk about Terry Pratchett and the Discworld novels.  

In a nutshell, Twoflower has taken everything he learned in The Color of Magic and The Light Fantastic and written a book about it. One thing leads to another and suddenly Rincewind is being summoned across the world to lead a revolution. The ending is a bit convenient, but it's really it's all about the journey, isn't it?

Characterwise, we have Rincewind (of course), but also the return of Twoflower Cohen the Barbarian. Great characters, just amusing as always. Especially when Cohen brings along some his entirely-too-old-but-don't-tell-them-that barbarian horde.  

Also: Hex. More or less a magical computer, built on some spinning gears, ants, and a fishtank that may just have ended up sentient, it's amusing. I expect to see it again.  

On the downside, there are a few times where you'll be listening along and suddenly... Wait, was that racist? The audiobook certainly doesn't help matters.  

On the awesomeside: The Luggage  {{< spoiler >}}has kids{{< /spoiler >}} now. That's a thing.  

Overall: probably my favorite Discworld book thus far (among only the Rincewind novels). It's not perfect, but it's getting there.
