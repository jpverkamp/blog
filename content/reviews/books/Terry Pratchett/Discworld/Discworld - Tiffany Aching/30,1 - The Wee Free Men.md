The Wee Free Men is a wonderful book. It's the Witches again, done YA this time around. It follows the story of Tiffany Aching--young witch to be--as she begins to discovers her powers and finds that the world may be just a bit more complicated than she (or the adults around her) thinks it is.

Tiffany is a great character. She's smart and strong and willing to do what has to be done. She's young enough that she can still _believe_ (which is handy even in a world where magic) yet still has a tendency to look up things she doesn't understand and approach problems logically. She'd make an excellent role model for young girls. I'll have to remember that in a few years.  

The Wee Free Men are pretty hilarious as well. I'm glad I listened to them in audiobook form. They're still a bit of fun trying to figure out what in the world they're saying. They're refreshingly straight forward and just need a bit of a guiding hand to be forces for good in the world.  

Overall, it's a great book and a great subseries which which to finish my Discworld journey. If you're just now starting out, especially if you're a younger reader, it works just as well as an introduction to the world as well.
