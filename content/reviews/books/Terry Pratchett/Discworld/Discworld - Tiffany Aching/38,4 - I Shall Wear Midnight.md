Tiffany Aching is back! Now she's a full witch, out on her own.  

Of course things are going to go wrong.  

<!--more-->

This time around, she has to defeat what feels like a spirit of hatred, witch trials given form.  

I really do like how Pratchett / the Discworld does witches, Tiffany Aching in particular. She's powerful because she's smart and tends to win because she's careful. She understands what she has to do and then goes out and does it. She's definitely among my favorite denizens of the Discworld.  

Overall, a solid book. Sad, but only in that the only Discworld book I have left is the last one. Onwards.
