In {{< goodreads book="Going Postal" >}}, Moist von Lipwig rebuilt the post office. In {{< goodreads book="Making Money" >}}, he took on the banks. Now? Steam engines are coming to the Discworld!  

On one hand, it's interesting to see more and more technology come to the Discworld, especially watching it blend with the magic that's already there. You have goblins running the clacks (telegraphs) and now the trains and a engine that might just be alive. On top of that, we're dealing with some of the fall out of the recent (bookwise) war between the Trolls and the Dwarves.

On the other hand, it's a fair bit weaker than the previous two Moist von Lipwig books. Seeing a conman apply himself to the betterment of the city was fascinating once, interesting twice, but is starting to run thin. Of course he's going to pull off some outlandish schemes and win in the end. So it goes.  

Overall, worth the read for the completeness sake. It will be interesting to head back to the early books...
