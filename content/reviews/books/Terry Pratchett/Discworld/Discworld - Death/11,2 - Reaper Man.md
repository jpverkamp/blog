> No one is finally dead until the ripples they cause in the world die away—until the clock wound up winds down, until the wine she made has finished its ferment, until the crop they planted is harvested. The span of someone’s life is only the core of their actual existence.

If it were your time to go, yet Death didn't come for you... what then?

Not terribly long story shorter, Death has been fired and has to get a day job. In the mean time, things are having this sudden tendency to not die.  

Death is one of my favorite characters in the Discworld books and, as odd it sounds, Reaper Man does a lot to make his character feel more human.  

It's a lovely book and a worthy successor to Mort. Onwards and Deathwards!
