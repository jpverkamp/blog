A slightly shorter entry into the Discworld universe and the last of the Death subseries, I just couldn't get into Thief of Time.  

There are some interesting ideas in there. The fifth horseman of the apocalypse. Mrs. War. The Auditors (again) trying to simplify their jobs. The personification of Time. A clock that can keep 'perfect' time and the trouble that would cause. History monks.

One surprising advantage the book has: Death is only present in limited quantities. I'm not sure there was really much else to do with the character, so this works well.  

Overall, I just couldn't get into it. So it goes. Back to the beginning for the next subseries!
