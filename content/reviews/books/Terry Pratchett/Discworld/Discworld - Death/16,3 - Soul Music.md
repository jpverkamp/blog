Soul Music fell somewhat flat for me.  

One one hand a Death story that only barely involves Death--although the parts that do are pretty amusing. It's yet another story of Death stepping down, this time getting temporarily replaced by his granddaughter of sorts, who just doesn't seem that interesting to me.

On the other hand, it's a story of how music with rocks in (rock and roll) came to the disk world. Unfortunately, it just seems to drag on about all of the various rock music puns and poking fun at how people live/dress/behave under the influence of rock music combined with some not so subtle jabs at music managers and the like.  

Overall, it's not terrible, but it's also not my favorite Discworld book by a long shot. If I ever reread the series (which is doubtful given how many books there are in the world), I'll probably give this one a pass.
