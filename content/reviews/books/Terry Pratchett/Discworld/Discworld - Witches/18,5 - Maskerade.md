The witches are back! Or at least Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg. Magrat's off being queen or somesuch.  

Short version of the plot: Phantom of the Opera, Discworld style.  

<!--more-->

Slightly longer version: Two witches isn't much of a coven, so Granny and Nanny set off to find a new third. Lucky for them Agnes Nitt (going by the name Perdita X / Perditax)--last seen in Lords and Ladies--is back and recruitable. She's singing at the Opera, highjinks ensue, and they more or less save the day.  

I never really cared overmuch for Magrat. Anges is a wonderful addition to the trio. It's a pity there's only one more witches book after this.  

As an aside, we also get a sprinkling of how the publishing industry works on the Discworld. Nanny Ogg has published a cookbook, the Joye of Snacks. Even if it's not super relevant to the main, opera storyline, it's still pretty hilarious:  

> What about this one? Maids of Honor?  
>
> Weeelll, they starts OUT as Maids of Honor...but they ends up Tarts.”  

Overall, it's probably actually my favorite witches book since the first and among my favorite Discworld books thus far. It's just a really fun read.  

Amusing--and yet entirely sensible--quote of the book:  

> “Walter Plinge said: "You know she asked me a very silly question Mrs Ogg! It was a silly question any fool knows the answer!"  
>
> "Oh, yes," said Nanny. "About houses on fire, I expect..."  
>
> "Yes! What would I take out of our house if it was on fire!"  
>
> "I expect you were a good boy and said you'd take your mum," said Nanny.  
>
> "No! My mum would take herself!"  
>
> "What would you take out then, Walter?" Nanny said.  
>
> "The fire!”
