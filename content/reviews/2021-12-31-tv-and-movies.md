I do a [post]({{< ref "2021-12-31-reading-retrospective" >}}) each year on books, but this year I also started reviewing movies and TV shows! I have *absolutely* no idea how much value people get out of this (and I'd love to [hear from you](mailto:blog@jverkamp.com)), but I enjoy doing it, so I'm not going to stop any time soon. :D

In any case, it's been a good year for movies and TV!

Overall, I watched:

* 55 movies
    * 25 from the [Marvel Cinematic Universe](/reviews/series/marvel-cinematic-universe/)
    * 5 Disney Animated Classics + 1 Home Release sequel ({{< crosslink "Bambi 2: The Great Prince of the Forest" >}})
    * 35 on Disney+ (mostly the MCU + kid's movies above)
    * 8 on HBOMax (new releases!)
    * 2 in theaters (oh Covid and having a baby...)

* 14 TV shows (46 total seasons)
    * 17 seasons of Stargate for another rewatch!
    * All 5 MCU TV series released this year
    * Mostly on Hulu (Stargate), but also Disney+ (MCU), and HBOMax (Watchmen and the Sopranos)

That's... a lot of media when you put it all in one place. And well worth it I'd say!

Based on a blog post from long ago, I still rank all movies I watch in one year:

{{< ranking "2021 Movie Reviews" >}}

It's really hard to do that though. Everything in roughly the first half/~20 movies I absolutely loved. Everything down to the mid 30s, I really enjoyed. Even down at the bottom, I still think they were interesting movies to watch, I just didn't like them nearly as much / could see their flaws. As I mentioned in my [reading retrospective]({{< ref "2021-12-31-reading-retrospective" >}}), I've come to the realization over the last year that I tend to like just about everything. But... I'm okay with that!

If you'd rather them ordered by the order I watched them in:

And here are my TV posts (in viewing order):

On to another fantastic year!
