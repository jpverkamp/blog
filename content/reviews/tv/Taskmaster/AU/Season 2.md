I have no idea how I ended up watching season 2 of Taskmaster Australia before Season 1, but go with it! It's not like there's *that* much of an overarching plot between seasons that you have to keep up with. 

And man, this is a fun bit. Another series, another Taskmaster! And another assistant!

Tom (Gleeson). And lesser Tom (Cashman) are a lot of fun together. I love that lesser Tom can never keep a straight face when teh contestants screw up. It's delightful. 

And oh the cast was a lot of fun. Anne and Lloyd as a couple on the show together made for some great moments. Wil and Tom being old friends is a dynamic we've seen before in the British version but it's always fun. Josh was quite a wildcard at times. And Jenny was one of the reasons I came to this version of the show--I've seen her acts on YouTube before and she's a wonderfully weird mix and has a lot of those 'young enough to make the other contestants feel old' moments. 

Overall, another great season of Taskmaster. I'm going to have to catch more of the Australian version! LIke season 1 :smile:. 

Love it. 

Onward!

## 1. *Don’t Slip on the Chips Old Man*<

Prize task: The thing that most doesn’t look like what it is called. 

Sea monkeys. Squirting. Chlamydia. A priest. Short bread. 

Oh this show. 

Task 1: Pop the balloons while wearing a seagull helmet, catch the chips (and only the chips) in the basket. 

> Jenny: While wearing your seagulls helmet… hehe. 

She’s fun. 

> Lloyd: Now I know how JFK felt. 
> Audience: (a mix of applause and gasps)
> …
> Tom: Now Lloyd why did you feel like JFK?
> Lloyd: Well it was the unexpected loud explosions around my head.
> Tom: Well after that, he felt dead. 
> Lloyd: I felt dead after I looked in the basket and only had two chips. 
> Lloyd: I was like, there’s a conspiracy. Is there a second seagull. 

Oh my. 

> Anne: AHH AHHH AHHHHH.

Also, vouchers. 

I … did not expect who actually slipped on the chips. That was *delightful*.

Task 2: Scariest scarecrow wins.

😄 

They actually set them out for 4 days (I presume each). That’s a delightful task. 

Josh: I went to bed that night and I started to get worried. Because my scarecrow really was like a series of perches. And I thought, oh my God, I’ve made a perfect habit for birds. And I was so worried about that, because I’m not going to win this. And then at like 2am, I thought, who doesn’t want to make a home for birds. That’s crazy thinking. That’s the kind of thinking that a property developer or like Peter Dutton would have. Of course I want to make a home for birds. That’s way better than five of your … dumb points you weren’t going to give me anyways.  So, I went out there and I made a beautiful home for birds and I feel like I’ve reconnected with who I am. And that’s the greatest prize of all. 

Tom: (blank face)

Lesser Tom: (trying desperately to not to laugh)

> Lesser: Tom One of them is Gen X and the other one is Jen-Y. It’s Will and Jenny. 

😃

> Jenny: It’s not my fault that birds are too stupid to understand the singularity.   Josh: That is how we all interpreted it. Apart from Lloyd.  
> Lloyd: Yeah, I made a scarecrow.

Double whammy.

> Tom: What does that mean for the scores Tom?
> Lesser Tom: Well it turns out that the scores are ooooh 5. Sorry, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5. 

Task 3: Make chess cool. Coolest chess wins. 

Anne. Before even reading the task. Licks the chess board. 😃

> Tom: Pretty hard to fault. Playing chess in outer space. 
> Jenny: Yeah and I had a lobster hat. 

She’s delightful. 

Josh’s dance off was by far the best version of this task though. 

He got robbed. 

> Josh: So you wanted me to do a dance routine where I just went like this?
> Tom: It would have been a lot more chess like. 
> Josh: How am I the autistic one? It’s not supposed to be literal. It’s supposed to be like an idea or like an advertisement. 

Lloyd’s chess on horseback was also delightful. 

Live Task: Silent disco. 4 of the 5 have music playing in their headphones, Tom has to guess the imposter. 

> Tom: I’m starting to feel like this is a task for me. 

## 2. *A Hotly Contested Auction*<

Prize task: make your parents tut tut. 

Didn’t really expect the title in this task. Lucy less for a debutant ball. 

> You know what I always say. When life gives you lemons… turn it into the first team task of the season!

Jenny is so yellow. 

First task: Toss lemons. Meters minus liters wins. 

> I’m not sure that you understood what’s going on there. 

That was some impressive fruit tossing! By one team. 😃

Second task: Do something vegetable with a root vegetable. 

> Lemme just picture it. I’m watching the Olympic. Someone jumps on a board. They split in half. You know what I’d do. 

Not to be outdone…

Beetroot marriage proposal. 

That is all. 

> It’s just me and you in the dark staring at sweet potato. 

As one does. 

> So, parsnip throwing.  I feel like we’ve stumbled on another Welsh national sport. 

He asked them to turn it into a task. Everybody else did it better. That’s absolutely delightful. 

Third task: Get the balls from this jar to that jar without touching them. 

> You mother f**ker. 

(this jar had no bottom…)

Their faces. Delightful. 

> Before this series, I thought I was really quite a competent human being. 

Oh Jenny. 

That’s Taskmaster for you. 

> It’s true. Is one of the best disqualifications I’ve ever seen. 

Not only that, but negative points!

Live task: Paint a thing that rhymes with your thing with your thing. 

More negative points!

A spread from 21 to 5. Quite an episode. 

## 3. *Answer the Phone Gary*<

Prize task: Most useful thing. 

The wheel? The concept of fire?

No. A red onion. 

After all:

> There’s water in the onion, but there’s not onion in the water. 

First task: Wear as much water as possible from the shower to the bath. 

> I was going for spine logic. 

… fair enough Jenny. Fair enough. 

> I’ve never tested the permeability of a parachute before. 

The fact that it started raining for Anne’s was fun. 

> Thanks God. 

She still didn’t win. 

Second task: Advertise for some random company. 

Jenny barely having any idea what a record was… makes me feel old. 

> So Lloyd are you the only Welshman that can’t sing?

Third task: What did the person who fixed the light two minutes ago look like?

> I feel cheated by you. Him. The whole show is a lie. 

Well…

> What’s with the fish?

 😃

Going to find him? Brilliant. They missed a chance to have someone else standing out there. 

(Jenny refusing to believe it was the same guy was so worth it.)

Live task: Get your team (but not the other team) to guess a word. 

> It starts with a D and ends with a G.  
> …  
> D G

Hoag having the lowest score at this point in the season along all of English speaking Taskmaster is delightful. And tells me there are Taskmasters in other languages?!

## 4. *Oink Oink B*****s*<

Babushka doll magazine. That little smile. 

Prize task: Make the crowd ooh. Tom is fun. 

Jenny giving the audience envelopes to queue them was pretty sneaky!

First task: Go as low as you can. 

I do love the contrast. First two completely ignore the limbo bar… who would just go and limbo? 

Well… the next two. Obviously. Who would just crawl under it? Well. 

> Jenny: Can I have the iPad back please?
> Tom: No! … What if I reset it?

And then she sends it off in a boat and starts insulting him. 

She’s delightful. 

Second task: Not about manta rays. About mantras. Yay. 

> You know what I like to say to my friends?
> No, I say “oink oink bitches”

I continue to fail to guess which task will provoke the episode title. 

Anne got … rather violent. I wonder if you’d see that in the US Taskmaster…

Third task: Do various things to balls into a van. 

Anne figuring it out! (Ish) And still totally failing. Delightful. 

Going into the final task with only a two point spread? Have we seen that before?!

Live task: Share a childhood task into an auto-tune microphone. Deceive Tom. 

> Jenny: Can I clarify? Is the point to deceive? 
> Tom: (makes the most ridiculous duh face)

Oh she’s fun. 

> Well I’m just trying to think, which of the contestants used to go on holidays to to Wollongong … and knows how to do a Welsh accent. 

Poor Lloyd. 😄 

## 5. *The Moment of Divorce is Recorded*<

Prize task: The thing to most improve a camping trip. 

> Tom: I love camping. 
> …
> Jenny: Like Lloyd, I had camping. I feel like only a psycopath enjoys camping. 

First task: Find Tom. He lies. 

lol. That was absolutely delightful. 

> I have never been so sure my phone was on silent…

Tom getting bored was fun as well. 😄 

> I’m in something that’s the right way up. 

Second task: Don’t do it. 

> Lesser Jenny: How was I meant to know that?
> Tom: You weren’t!
> Lesser Jenny: Oh man. Why were you wearing a jacket?
> Lesser Tom: I think I look cool.

She got bored in a few minutes 😄. 

> Jenny: And I feel like this is how I find out that I have ADHD.

Not even 3 minutes. 

> Tom: Lloyd I feel like you left not knowing what the task was. 
> Lloyd: I have been wondering for four months waht I did. I didn’t see the sign. Unlike Ace of Bass.
> (to Jenny) 
> I’ll explain that later.  

Delightful. 

Josh and Wil having a stubborn off was a delightful contrast to Jenny. 

Third task: Invent and promote an original conspiracy theory. 

> Jenny: You won’t believe the reason why you’re horny all the time.

Oh my. 

Lesser Tom… oh my.

> Jenny: See you next time.
> Wil: Stay horny!

Live task: Make the sound of the thing on your drum.

… Wils’ were delightful. 

## 6. *Everyone Here is a Nerd*<

Prize task: The thing you would marry if you could.

Having a couple among the contestants… that have been together (but not married) for years. 😄 

And then food. 

First task: Show off one of your senses. (Penalty for choosing the same as someone else)

> Josh: How many do I have to do to show it off. 
> (Lesser) Tom: A hundred. (raises eyebrows)

I love watching him when the contestants are doing bonkers things. 

And they’re always doing bonkers things. 

> Tom: So Josh, you said you were going to do a hundred. You didn’t get to a hundred. How many did you try do you think? 
> Josh: As many as Tom would get to me.
> Tom: Ok which was how many do you think?
> Josh: I don’t know.
> Tom: *rolls his eyes*

Second task: When the game of duck duck duck duck duck duck goose. 

Delightful logic puzzles. 

It starting to rain super hard during Josh’s task was fun. 

> (Lesser Tom): I’m really regretting giving you a pen.

After 42 minutes… she finally asked her first question.

After 1hr 26min, she finished her 5th (and final) question and … she {{<spoiler>}}still didn’t get it right{{</spoiler>}}.

> Josh: It’s weird, because it’s so much smarter than me. But it’s so dumb. 

Third task: Fluke something. 

> Lloyd: Do you have any sharp knives? 

…

> Jenny: Could we set up the duck duck goose thing again? 

That’s delightful. 

(She {{<spoiler>}}got it wrong{{</spoiler>}} again.)

Final task: Do … weird things. 

> … with 423,820 Hundreds and Thousands …

They weighed them. 

Right? 

## 7. *You’ve Gotta Find the Slop*

Prize task: A thing that’s great to have one of… and worse the more you have.

> Jenny: I have brought in the Plan B pill. 
> …
> Also also, my dad, he’s in the crowd tonight. 

Oh my. 

Noses. Skulls. Booze. Buttholes. 

> Josh: It’s kind of like the nose in many ways.

…

> Tom: That’s enough cider and buttholes for one night. Let’s get on to the good stuff.

First task: Find the minivan in the sock. 

Sneaky sneaky.

Josh just ignoring Tom’s increasingly blatent hints and pulling every single sock down was the best. 

> Josh: I think if I was completely wrong, you would have sort of hinted by now. 

1hr 43min. 

All the socks.

Second task: Go full slop mode. 

Man they’re really going into the whole ‘just don’t tell the contestants anything and see what happens’ this season. 

Third task: Make yourself look extremely strong or extremely weak. 

> Tom: I’m still reflecting on you calling the ancient olympic games the OG olympics.
> Lesser Tom: Old and Greek. 
> Tom: … fair enough. 

Wil pulling the car… and the ropes obviously slack behind him was fun. 

Anne… is a horse. That is all. 

Prize task: With your time, perform a task to represent the shown time. 

The first guess being two minutes off was pretty awesome. I’m actually really impressed in general at those. 

## 8. *Dingo Dongo*

Prize task: An object that has really seen some shit. 

Anne and Lloyd sharing a brain. 😄 

Wil just *absolutely* elevating the idea of bringing toilet paper was amazing. 

Tom did not agree sadly.

First task: Break the eggs from the furthest distance. 

> Lloyd: And now I realize that I do not agree with me. 

32cm. Not bad. 

Second task: With your team identify as many objects as you can through the mattress. 

> Anne: I’m not that way inclined
> Josh: What way inclined.
> Anne: I mean—useful to the world. 

It ended up much better!

Third task: Show a different side of yourself. 

> Lesser Tom: If you didn’t get me with butt—you’re going to have a hard time winning me over with balls.

It ended up so wholesome. 

Prize task: Bubble Quiddich. 

That was hilarious. 

Especially the defense. 

## 9. *Killed by a Nerd*

Prize task: An object that should be a movie. 

Duck. Jesus table. Nokia. Barbie[^aus]. Eczema. 

Oh this show. 

[^aus]: It's funny because they're Australian. 

First task: Make this balloon hover the longest. 

> Lloyd: That could have went better. 
> Josh: I need to learn to believe in myself. Because sometimes things aren't as terrible as Lloyd. 

I'm so glad Anne did the helium voice thing. 

> Jenny: I'm thinking I'm really quite smart. Maybe this task is too simple. 

And then they talked for the rest of the time about marshmallows. 

Second task: Record a family home video. 

> Tom: Why did you want to make the story heartwarming by evoking the memory of 9/11...

Third task: Win the pub quiz. 

Lloyd's third task: Write the pub quiz for the other contestants. They must come in this specific order. 

Oh that's sneaky. 

And *so* hard to arrange. 

> Lloyd: On 9/11 which of the planned targets wasn't hit. 

...

Third task: Make a surprising appearance. 

Josh hiding in a locker was impressive. 

Jenny of course filmed vertically. 

Final task: Toss the most thongs with the tongs onto the barbecue. 

A classical game of tong the thongs. 

As one does. 

Poor Jenny was so excited when she got a "remove the thongs thong" onto her own. But hey. She wasn't disqualified. 

Oh this show. 

## 10. *Fun Sexy Wrestle*

Prize task: Something Lloyd has never heard of. 

Jenny having a touching book... but it turns out that Lloyd and Anne are not actually *married* married. Oops. And to learn on national television. 

First task: Go to the best place. Avoid getting caped by Tom’s camera. 

Everyone did so bad. 😀

Second task: Apply for your childhood dream job. 

Lloyd wanted to be an actor. 

Third task: Throw something at Tom. 

Prize task: Build a tower or of the marshmallows from your dressing room. 

And Lloyd asked for it to be replaced with fruit long ago. 

A fun end.
