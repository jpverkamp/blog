Finally back to where it all began. We have a bit of trying to find the show's footing. I think Romesh Ranganathan was my favorite this series. 

Favorite task:

* Episode 1, Task 2: Eat as much watermelon as possible in one minute. HULK SMASH! Also, totally throwing up. 

It's probably the weakest season, but it more than gets a pass for all the wonderful things that came to be later.
