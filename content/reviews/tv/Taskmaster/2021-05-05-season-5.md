More out of order! This time back to Series 5! 

Contestants:

* Aisling Bea: Irish names are kind of crazy looking sometimes. And so is Aisling Bea. She has a wonderful sort of manic energy throughout the show. 
* Bob Mortimer: He has some of the most bananas ways of solving tasks. Great fun. 
* Mark Watson: A wonderfully dry sense of humor. You can never quite be sure if he's serious or messing with you. 
* Nish Kumar: Poor Nish. He totally got robbed. I'm noticing a theme here...
* Sally Phillips: You never expect half the things she does. There's a reason she did as well as she did. 

A few favorite moments:

* Episode 1, Task 2: Give Alex a special cuddle. So awkward.
* Episode 1, Task 3: Get Alex onto dry land as elegantly as possible. One contestant drifts off into the weeds, another strips down. 'Elegantly'. 
* Episode 3, Task 3: Make a coconut look like a businessman. It's wonderful. 
* Episode 3, Task 3: Make Marmite. Or alternatively, just use booze. It's amusing how well that works. 
* Episode 3, Task 4 (part 2): Play a game of spot the difference. I'm amazed at how well the {{< spoiler >}}Alex swap{{< /spoiler >}} went. Best part... they did the same thing in the studio at one point!
* Episode 3, Task 2: Balance Alex on a see-saw. A brilliant or terrible idea... well. You'll have to watch and find out.
