We're almost caught up to the present day! And what a crew to catch up on. 

Mae Martin I think was my favorite, followed closely by Ivo Graham. Ironic given the final scores. :smile:

I did love Jenny Eclair's energy throughou the tasks though. And both Frankie and Kiell were a delight to watch as well. Really, I loved the entire cast. 

Favorite task of the season? Wayne. The flail'y man. 

Go watch it and find out why. :smile:

Episode by episode reviews, now with slightly less screenshots (that was bonkers).

## 1. *The Curse of Politeness*

> Greg: I just don't think eggs are very dependable. 
> Jenny: Well they don't think you are either. 

A good start. 

And then right to a wedding first dance. With Alex. And without us (the audience) able to hear the music at all. 

Delightful. 

And of course:

> I said, 'May I?' And they said, 'I Mae.' 'You may?' I said. And they said. 'Aye, I Mae.' And there will be lots more fun bits like that throughout the series.  

And to

> Iâ€™ve never seen gameplay like thatâ€¦ in 15 series. 

This will be a good one. 

## 2. *Trapped in a Loveless Marriage*

> I knew it had to be a feet thing. Cause feet are weird innit? Like, what are they? 

The object that makes you feel the weirdest... 

Delightful. 

> For some reason, people in the Middle Ages couldn't paint cats. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-b10936.jpeg)

The first task with air trumpet/drums/cello/etc though? New favorite of the series!

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-66a913.jpeg)

With Greg giving out three 5s and two 4s...

>  Greg: I've literally lost my God damned mind. 

I believe he agrees...

Anyways. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-53a689.jpeg)

Potato. 

She's got a wonderful energy. 

I mean. 

> I need to find a dying frog. 

All that... for three 1 point scores! And no 5s. Oh this ridiculous show. 

Also, Mae Martin's beavering joke! ðŸ˜„

## 3. *I Love up Squander Promise*

> And the most heroic thing should get 5 points. As long as he doesn't go wacky with his scoring. 9 points. 1 point. I don't know; everyone can have 17 points. He's a wonderful boss. 

ðŸ˜‚ 

Speaking of heroic:

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-582a03.jpeg)

> Alex: So did anything you planned with?
> Ivo: No. No. Because it's f... so stupid. 

## 4. *How Heavy is the Water?*

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-52a4ca.jpeg)

Right. 

Arguing for entirely too long about the definition of throwing. Delightful. 

> Greg: That's it! I'm letting them get away with it!

Such chaos. 

And then. Boats!

> Jenny: You know these... the foamy tit cups. They'll act as a bouncy aid. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-a7372e.jpeg)

>Greg: I dunno; I'm thinking it still counts. I'm going to give him the five. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-fe62c0.jpeg)

> I just said that to have a look at Kiell's face. 

And then there is Ivo's:

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-163534.jpeg)

And it ends on... a most remarkable tie. 

Oh this show. 

## 5. *Old Honkfoot*

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-e83a44.jpeg)

Wat. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-04748e.jpeg)

Of course. 

A wonderful team task:

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-757473.jpeg)

I ... don't know if they ever realized he couldn't see. 

And a final team task:

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-c3fedf.jpeg)

Delightful chaos. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-d7b1ab.jpeg)

All the better with a 15 point spread over two tasks...

## 6. *It's My Milk Now*

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-bdee78.jpeg)

I Spy. 

Say it out loud 

Anyways. 

> Ivo: Come on Greg. Don't you want to bathe with her?

You will absolutely never guess who 'she' is. 

(The Titanic.)

(Told you.)

Anyways.

> Alex: I mean. I don't think I've ever seen anyone peel an egg this badly. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-1d4f40.jpeg)

That... is the most green. But it's not a red green. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-21e8f4.jpeg)

So close. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-0c6335.jpeg)

## 7. *Schrodinger's Egg*ï¿¼

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-e5333d.jpeg)

Yes. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-b37886.jpeg)

Like an escape room!

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-475438.jpeg)

He knew. 

> Ivo: I've already lost the episode. I just wanted to have a go at it. 

Oh he's delightful. 

## 8. *100% Bosco*

> Jenny: Come on big boy. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-3439ce.jpeg)

What is a pineapple, after all?

Or a banana?

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-ec8cba.jpeg)

This season does have quite a few team final tasks:

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-1249e3.png)

## 9. *A Show About Pedantry*

> Ivo: And thatâ€™s my face.

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-fe6c08.png)

A whole task where if you look at or talk to Alexâ€¦ you lose. 

Oh this show. 

## 10. *A Yardstick for Failure*

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-df1863.png)

That is a wonderful get up for a finale. 

And now there are two of them:

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-fba63a.png)

Thatâ€™s quite the high bar for the first prize task entry for the finale. 

It just keeps escalating. 

And then... chess?

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-96e8ad.jpeg)

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-7cca0a.jpeg)

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-8a99b8.jpeg)

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-15-textbundle-95f562.jpeg)

Fin.
