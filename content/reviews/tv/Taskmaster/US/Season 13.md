> No way. 

So many quotes. So many ducks. So many chances to make Alex do *weird* things. 

It was another great series. I love this show. At some point I'm going to run out... and have to watch the New Zealand and now Australian versions! (I can't wait). 

The contestants: 

- Ardal O'Hanlon - The older one / the Irish one. Always seemed up for doing the wackiest thing and I loved his sense of humor. 
- Bridget Christie - The chaotic one. She seemed to actually be driving Alex up the wall as the series went on, which is saying something. 
- Chris Ramsey - The relatable one. Gives you something to grown you among all the other oddballs. 
- Judi Love - The one who loses at just about every task. And she's just so delightful about it--and about making Alex do much of the tasks for her. 
- Sophie Duker - The younger one and my favorite of the series. She's just got a delightfully weird way of looking at the tasks.

Series reviews:

## 1. *The noise that blue makes*

That's a weird prize task to start with. 

> If something's on the street ... it's yours. 
> All: yeah!

The first task (duck!)... near the ceiling. They're not all that tall Alex!

Duck!

DUCK!

Second tasks, of course no context necessary:

> Woodpeckers must be hard as f***. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-13-4456bf.png)

Third task... a duel!

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-13-233306.png)

More or less. 

Sophie's (modern!) rap battle was by far the best. Bonus points for making Greg Davis feel old...

So far... I think Sophie might be my favorite. 

## 2. *Birdie Hand Finger*

Impressing aliens with... weird paintings. Rubic's cube. And a mirror--with an accent that apparently has trouble with those Rs. 

Blind folded spinning? 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-13-f2ce91.png)

Always a good time. 

Presented without context:

> Greg Davis: Iâ€™m very aware of the teats. 

Yup. 

## 3. *I Think Iâ€™ve Got This*

Bubbles. Bubbles bubbles. Bubbles. 

Bubbles!

Bubbles bubbles?

Bubbles. 

STOP COCK. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-13-b082aa.jpeg)

Pheasant plucker. 

Anyways. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-13-44cefa.jpeg)

Delightful chaos. 

{{<spoiler>}}Bridget getting 25 points; two tasks at 6 eachâ€¦ that was something new!{{</spoiler>}}

## 4. *Shoe Who*

Itâ€™s truly something to see Alex actually get irritated. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-13-fe7beb.jpeg)

I liked â€˜Guess Shoeâ€™ personally. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-13-2534c2.jpeg)

Meow. 

## 5. *Having a little chuckle*

Two part tasks, especially when youâ€™re inadvertently making life difficult for yourself? Delightful. 

Direct competitionsâ€¦ for third place? Even better. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-13-cf582f.jpeg)

> If Iâ€™d got here quicker then Iâ€™d probably done all right in this task. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-13-fab960.jpeg)

And so it endsâ€¦

(Stick around for a quick shot at the end of the credits!)

## 6. *The 75th Question*

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-13-daac99.jpeg)

Oh Bridget. 

Also, 

> No, you got beaten by everyone. 

Savage. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-13-d510f6.jpeg)

There are just so many Greg doing weird things for perfectly reasonable reasons this episode. 

## 7. *Heg*

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-13-9628c4.jpeg)

Itâ€™s going to be that sort of episode then. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-13-59aa29.jpeg)

But the best part? Make a 150g edible arrangement. And then for part 2â€¦. Oh they should have seen that coming. 

Iâ€™m impressed they made it even that far. 

And yetâ€¦

> Greg: If I place your tofu ballerina above a vagina, Iâ€™m finished. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-13-ca781b.jpeg)

## 8. *You Tuper Super*

The return of Fred the Swede. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-13-27ff7e.jpeg)

> As it turned out, I could speak Swedish all along. 

I thinkâ€¦ Alex might actually regret the tongue taskâ€¦ 

## 9. *It Might be Wind*

> Alex: I donâ€™t like it. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-13-9e3c4a.jpeg)

> Judi: I was surprised how much I looked like a damn fish. 

It gets weirder. 

> Greg: I wasnâ€™t expecting you to use an actual human baby. 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-13-47be73.jpeg)

And I quote:

> He was hoping you would think it was his neck. 

â€¦ Judi was robbed. :(

(Watch Sophie carefully)
## 10. *The House Queens*

> Just so you know, you can store blood for 42 days. 

No. You get no context. 

ðŸ˜ƒ

(Not context)

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-13-693726.jpeg)

>Chris: Youâ€™re a psychopath. 

Sometimes, Bridget just screws around. And sometimesâ€¦ sheâ€™s brilliant. Also Sophie swapping the arrows. 

But the real standout?

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-13-1b35c3.jpeg)

> Judi: The ducks felt some motherly instincts. They wanted to be nursed in these breasts. 

Delightful. 

Singing: The boys going on about some aubergine task that only they had to do. And then the womenâ€¦ 

![](/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-13-fabcaf.jpeg)

That was surprisingly good. 

Side note: Sophieâ€™s earrings are delightful.
