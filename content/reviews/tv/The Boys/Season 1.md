Iâ€™ve previously watched the first season and read the comics, but with season 3 out now (and I havenâ€™t reviewed the show previously), letâ€™s watch it again. Should be interesting seeing whatâ€™s different this time. 

Wow that's violent. Just as bad if not worse than the comics, since you get to see it all on screen. But in a way that actually has some solid visuals and crazy scenes.

## Individual thoughts and (not so) pretty pictures. Spoilers: 


## 1. *The Name of the Game*

Here we go again. 

![](/embeds/tv/attachments/the-boys-s1-3f8735.png)

Jesus. 

![](/embeds/tv/attachments/the-boys-s1-1a90b1.png)

Immediately contrasted with a training montage. 

Oh this show. 

> Why would you get into this business? If not to save the world. 

> â€” Starlight

Oh dear.

![](/embeds/tv/attachments/the-boys-s1-1f7171.png)

> Well, well, well. If it ainâ€™t the invisible cunt. 

> â€” Butcher

Heâ€™s fun. In a crude sort of way. 

## 2. **Cherry**

![](/embeds/tv/attachments/the-boys-s1-e0d494.png)

Girl power! Good for her. 

Oh Frenchie. Heâ€™sâ€¦ quite the character. 

And so begins the murder. 

## 3. *Get Some*

![](/embeds/tv/attachments/the-boys-s1-1485ed.png)

Motherâ€™s Milk

> Thatâ€™s aâ€¦  nickname? 

> â€” Hughie

I think I prefer show Hughie. 

![](/embeds/tv/attachments/the-boys-s1-8cb15b.png)

Snarky supes. I like Maeve. 

## 4. *The Female of the Species*

Oh Deep dealing with some issues. Heâ€™s still a creep, but at the same time trying to be better? For at least the fishy sort of better. 

![](/embeds/tv/attachments/the-boys-s1-17c1ae.png)

![](/embeds/tv/attachments/the-boys-s1-f58766.png)

Or not. 

An an introduction of /The Female/. Oh sheâ€™s quite the character. 

![](/embeds/tv/attachments/the-boys-s1-b91803.png)

Hughie and Starlight are so cute. And oh heâ€™s so conflicted. 

> You see. When theyâ€™re apart, theyâ€™re absolute fucking rubbish. But. You put them together. Theyâ€™re the goddamn fucking Spice Girls. 

> â€” Butcher

I donâ€™t know anyone else who could have delivered that lineâ€¦

## 5. *Good for the Soul*

![](/embeds/tv/attachments/the-boys-s1-dd8628.png)

Evangelical Christianity, supe style. 

And of courseâ€¦ 

![](/embeds/tv/attachments/the-boys-s1-973647.png)

â€¦the plot thickens!

![](/embeds/tv/attachments/the-boys-s1-57b243.png)

Oh Butcher.  Your insane over the top... youness really does make the show. 

## 6. *The Innocents*

Seeing just how much of the Seven and supes in general being constructed is absolutely fascinating. 

> Well, your feral pixie dream girl ain't exactly dictating her fucking memoirs, is she Frenchie? 

> -- Butcher

Oh, Butcher is just wonderful. ðŸ˜„ 

![](/embeds/tv/attachments/the-boys-s1-cc66d6.png)

Getting to her...

> You know, you're always calling people cunts or twats, but I never really ogt how that's an insult. They're flexible, take a poudning, and they're the reason behind like 98% of my life descisions. 

> -- Hughie

The relationship/contrast between Hughie is great. 

And then the 'hurt by supes' support group. Oy. 

## 7. *The Self-Preservation Society*

![](/embeds/tv/attachments/the-boys-s1-f3dd2b.png)

How they all met. This will of course not go well. 

![](/embeds/tv/attachments/the-boys-s1-fe81d2.png)

Daw. This will of course not go well. 

Although to be fair, it's the penultimate episode of Season 1. Of course things are going to go sideways. 

![](/embeds/tv/attachments/the-boys-s1-97f873.png)

> A-Train: How does this not all start with you Hughie? The only difference between you and me Hughie, is that I made a mistake. The shit that you did is on purpose. 

Oy. 

![](/embeds/tv/attachments/the-boys-s1-30d5f5.png)

Making us feel for the Deep. Oy. Continual oy.

... and what happened to Rebecca Butcher. Oh... my. 

## 8. *You Found Me*

![](/embeds/tv/attachments/the-boys-s1-94cbda.png)

Yeah... Homelander is kind of terrifying. 

And... the government is kind of terrifying. 

Good times. 

![](/embeds/tv/attachments/the-boys-s1-0d1756.png)

They're trying to make me feel for the Deep... I'm not sure what to think about that. 

![](/embeds/tv/attachments/the-boys-s1-b9d15a.png)

Oy.

![](/embeds/tv/attachments/the-boys-s1-48b2f2.png)

... oy. 

Oh the twists. {{<spoiler>}}Becca is alive and Homelander got her pregnant. That's just... a thing. And I don't think he's even lying.{{</spoiler>}}
