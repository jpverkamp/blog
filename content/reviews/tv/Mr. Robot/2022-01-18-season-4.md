Wow. That really went quite a fascinating direction. I was wondering where they were going for the last few seasons, but really digging into the aftermath of the season 1 hacks + another big target + dealing with the fallout of the Dark Army + digging deeper into Elliot's troubles. 

Man. Quite a season.

I had my doubts in the run up to the final few episodes, but I think they really stuck the landing. This was quite a show, through and through. Well worth the watch.

Mini-reviews per episode, potential spoilers: 

1. __401 Unauthorized__

    That's a great episode naming pattern. :D

    Crazy episode. Everyone is so very broken... or dead. Or both. Going to be quite a final ride I think. 

    It's fascinating how abruptly a few of those plots were wrapped up. 

2. __402 Payment Required__

    The ... Deus Group? I wonder if we'll ever actually get any answers for what they're really trying to do. 

    Bit of a weird episode overall. Price is breaking, Elliot and Darlene's mom is apparently dead, and the taxidermy lady is thoroughly creepy. 

   Oh right. That's who Susan Jacobs is/was. Oy. And Vera. Double oy. 

3. __403 Forbidden__

    A young Whiterose. Fascinating. 

    Elliott's gone dark... and Mr. Robot is becoming the voice of reason? Oh my. 

    Vera... I do not (yet) understand why they needed to bring that particular plotline back, given the ones they killed off. 

    Newcomer, Olivia... Oh Elliot you single minded idiot sometimes. That was actually pretty sweet. 

    > If I hate myself enough to start using again, I might as well kill myself. 

    Oy. 

4. __404 Not Found__

    Darlene and a drunk Santa; Tyrell, Elliot, and Mr. Robot enjoying nature; and Dom being sexually frustrated. 

    A truly strange, low key but creepy but also emotional episode'oof that's a mix. 

    > Besides. I think you're the only person I know that actually likes me. 

    Oh this show. 

5. __405 Method Not Available__

   Loved the heist scene! Poor Dom. 

6. __406 Not Acceptable__

   Vera plot? Weird and I wasn't sure why it was still going on. ... Vera monologging about little bitch's xmas bat? One heck of a scene. That is going to get interesting. 

   The parallels scenes between Elliot and Darlene's previous relationships; also powerful. Man Elliot is ruthless/ununderstanding sometimes. 

   > You know, I may work for monsters'
   > 
   > ... but you are one. 
   >
   > And you're the worst kind; because you don't even know it. 

   And Dom and Darlene. Oooooy. Taxidermy lady is so very wonderful creepy. 

7. __407 Proxy Authentication Required__


   > ... shit and puke poured out of me ...

   Oh this show. This was one heck of a crazy episode... given that it took place in two rooms with only 6 (5?) characters... Oy.

8. __408 Request Timeout__

    Dang taxidermy lady is nuts. And Dom is awesome. 

    OTOH, I *did not* expect to see someone {{<spoiler>}}out crazy even her{{</spoiler>}}. 

    Also, poor crazy Elliot. So much mind screw. 

9. __409 Conflict__

    Dang. Biggest thing since 5/9... Quite a mess. 

    And there are still a handfull of episodes left. 

10. __410 Gone__

    A well needed cooling off after the last few episodes. More time with Darlene and Dom (oh broken people). 

    And of course, Leon:

    > Leon: Besides, I've gotta find a rest stop anyway. Gotta steal me a mirror real quick.
    >
    > Dominique DiPierro: ...
    > 
    > Leon: What, do you not know your Vonnegut? I gotta take a whiz, okay? Too many Code Reds this mornin'. sighs. Man, nobody fuckin... reads anymore.

    Side note: If everyone suddenly has X more e-coin, isn't the obvious next thing a spike in inflation of just about everything?

11. __eXit__

    > Elliot: You're right. I hate people. 

    Fun Society? Nah. Fuck Society. I... can't believe I didn't think of that. 

   > Elliot: ... something that I can't. They love me. 

    Elliot in defense of humanity. And I still need to know what Whiterose's project us... 

    And then in the third last episode... everything does *really* sideways. This is a bizarre time for it'

12. __whoami__

    > Elliot: If I see her, will this world make more sense? Or less?

    A seriously weird turn. Elliot's a few steps worse now?

13. __Hello, Elliott__

    Elliot(s)! Mr. Robot! Dom! A wedding!

    That... was not at all how I expected this show to end, but you know... I think they pulled it off. 

    Oy.
