After Season 1 wrapped up, where do you even go from there? They finished their big goal. Dealing with the fallout is the obvious answer... or ramping things up even further. We get a bit of both in Season 2, mostly with even more big twists from Elliot's entirely confusing mind but also a plot that is both deeper and more terrifying than I would have thought at first. 

It's not quite as solid as Season 1, in most part because it's not quite as new and fresh. But it's still very good and well worth the watch. Whatever shall we learn in Season 3?!

   Time passes. Society collapses. Elliot goes crazy(er). A rough episode, but I’m more than willing to give it some time to build back up.

   > It worked because the public believed the government had everything under control.
   >
   > You see, that is the business model for this great nation of ours.
   >
   > Every business day when that market bell rings, we con people into believing in something, the American dream, family values.

   Angela’s settled on a price and Elliot’s realizes he’s not _actually_ doing any better. Both fascinating to see what’s next.

   On the other hand… I have no idea where the Wellick storyline is going.

3. **eps2.2_k3rnel-pan1c.ksd**

   Euphoric Elliot is bizarre… New character Dominique of the FBI is going to be an interesting time. Finally things are moving again.

   The FBI finally finding a sign that literally reads fsociety is hilarious.

4. **eps2.3_init-1.asec**

   Flashback: And so Mr. Robot came to be.

   Personally I find the proposed chess match and other plotlines building up fascinating. It’s a slow episode, but worthwhile.

   Also, {{< spoiler >}}has anyone directly interacted with Leon?{{</ spoiler >}}

   > Man: Ma'am, if I may, why drug him? It would have been just as easy to shoot and leave.

   > {{< spoiler >}}Joanna Wellick{{</ spoiler >}}: Killing a man instantly robs him of explanation. He has no time to process his final moments. Now, even though he was paralyzed, his mind was still able to understand why his life was ending.
   >
   > We let him die with answers. Otherwise... We're nothing but ruthless murderers.
   >
   > Thank you.

   Wow. That’s cold.

   And the FBI closes in … on China/the Dark Army. That entire plotline is growing far more interesting.

   > Elliot: I wanted to s-stop seeing him before I talked to you again.
   >
   > Angela: And?
   >
   > Elliot: And my dead father's standing behind you right now

   ... Well that's certainly a thing. Even in a show where you never know quite who/what's real, that's quite a thing.

   Not that it gets any less dark when the truth comes out.

   On Angela's plot point, it doesn't really make the least bit of sense that she actually has to type in any commands, just make it run automatically. But it's kind of neat seeing her get deeper into everything.

7. **eps2.6_h4ndshake.sme**

   Well that's a potential sign off a the Roy and Wellick plotlines. I wonder if we'll ever know for sure...

   Speaking of which... holy crap they did it again. This show y'all. I knew something was up, but once again--not exactly what the up was.

8. **eps2.7_succ3ss0r.p12**

   Less twist and more escalation... Oy. Just oy.

   fsociety setting up in a high level E-Corp's home was always a little weird. And here's exactly why.

9. **eps2.7_init_5.fve**

    Ah. So that’s how we ended up {{< spoiler >}}in prison {{</ spoiler >}}…

    I’m really not sure what’s going in with either Elliot or Angela / Dominique. We’ll just have to see. 

    And of course… here we go again. 


10. **es2.8_h1dden-pr0cess.axx**

    Driving towards a conclusion… and there are still so many questions up in the air. 

11. **eps2.8_pyth0n-pt1.p7z**

    I feel like I missed something with Angela. That went very surreally sideways… which for this show is saying something. 

    And then there’s Dom. She’s got some issues and the FBI is kind of stuck on this one. Really weird scene with Alexa…

    And and… Old friends? What’s even real any more?

12. **eps2.9_pyth0n-pt2.p7z**

    > You know what that means?
    > 
    > It means that you are not on some TV show.
    > 
    > This isn't "Burn Notice." There are no blue skies for you out there.

    So very meta. That was a pretty crazy conclusion to the series, what with {{< spoiler >}}Tyrell being *not dead* and all--totally thought he was another figment of Elliot{{< /spoiler >}}, everything the FBI knows, and stage 2... So much chaos. As a place to end, it works. Really need to be going on now! Not to mention, what *does* Angela know?
