Well that's quite a season. It's great to see how Christopher has been growing over the series--man that penultimate episode though. The introduction and arc of Tony B (Buscemi is wonderful) is quite a thing. It just keeps picking up. Crazy to think there's only one more season, even if almost double length.

Mini-reviews per episode:

- *Two Tonys*: The old guard’s the new guard, Christopher and Paulie are (still) butting heads and perhaps they don’t have to whack Carmine after all. Unexpected turn with Dr. Melfi too. 
- *Rat Pack*: Hustling air bags… yup. they’re expensive. Wait, this one isn’t called two Tonys? He’s very Buscemi. He just makes everything slightly more… odd. Also wait what… Janice *married* Bobby? When? Why?!
- *Where’s Johnny?*: Old faces make for rather a mess in the leadership. Oh and Uncle Junior is having some issues. Oy an episode. 
- *All Happy Families…* Ooh boy the Sopranos are a mess. And Feech is a mess. AJ is a mess. 
- *Irregular Around the Margins*: Kind of surreal listening to them talk about war in the Middle East… 20 years later. And then… Ade and Tony. I just. Oy. I guess I didn’t expect sobriety to Kay forever, but… Oy. Buscemi is wonderful. 
- *Sentimental Education*: A very strange episode. I… kept expecting things to go sidewise. I guess in the end… 
- *In Camelot*: Things worse than drugs, Tony’s  father’s old flame (of course not everything was rosy) and Uncle Junior’s a funeral junky. Quite an episode. 
- *Marco Polo*: Mostly a surprise party foot Carmela’s father, but also a bit of redemption perhaps. 
- *Unidentified Black Males*: Finn’s in over his head… And Carmela learns the hard way about breaking up with a mob boss. Oy. 
- *Cold Cuts*: Oh Janice. Could have done without … any of her plotlines really. I guess she did try. And Tony’s reaction is worth it. But… why don’t they just dump the bodies i. thw water to begin with. 
- *The Test Dream*: Well… that went quickly weird. 
- *Long Term Parking*: And that was intense. That’s what a penultimate episode should be. Oy. 
- *All Due Respect*: Well. That’s an ending. It’s all about family, but sometimes family has conflicts. No idea where they are going with AJ.
