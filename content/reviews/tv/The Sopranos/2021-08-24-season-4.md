Man that was another season. Ralphie is a great character to love to hate, Christopher is really having some drug issues, and things really come to a head between Tony and Carmela. A great season and I look forward to the next. 

Mini-reviews per episode:

- All Debts, Public and Private: {{< spoiler >}}Ralphie and Janice now… come on {{</ spoiler >}}. 
- No-Show: Meadow is moody, Christopher is moving up—that’s going to be trouble. 
- Christopher: Columbus versus Native Americans. That’s a complicated issue… not about to be resolved in an episode. Add on another random death {{< spoiler >}}poor Bacala :/{{</ spoiler >}}. And Ralphie continues to be an ass. But that’s not new. Weird one. 
- The Weight: The power of a mobster when a slight is felt. Eventually that will (I hope) catch up with Ralphie. 
- Pie-o-My: Adriana, trying to do the right thing in a tricky situation. Carmela, trying to do the right thing in a tricky situation. And… horses. Apparently. Odd sometimes. 
- Everybody Hurts: Oh Christopher. Oh Artie. Oh AJ. Man everything is about to blow one way or another. 
- Watching Too Much Television: Well  Christopher is an ass… The politics of real estate is fascinating. Also Furio feels the same… it doesn’t?
- Mergers and Acquisitions: Ah. Cancer. And Tony and Ralphie are so going to have to end things one way or another… And Furio. So many things… Looking forward to some endings. 
- Whoever Did This: Finally. 
- The Strong, Silent Type: Well, that’s a thing. Drugs are one hell of a drug. 
- Calling All Cars: What is Janice doing… What is AJ doing… man this is screwy. 
- Eloise: Speaking of what are they doing… Furio and Carmela. Oy. 
- Whitecaps: And that’s the straw that broke the camels back. On to next season… At least the HUD/Carmine, Uncle Junior, and Christopher on drugs plots are resolved. More or less.
