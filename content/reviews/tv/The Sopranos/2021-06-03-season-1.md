After the crazy violence and nudity of [Watchmen]({{< ref "2021-05-11-watchmen" >}}), you'd think perhaps we'd go for something a little more ... safe for next time around. 

Nah. 

The Sopranos. 

It's one of the best rated TV shows of all time (on IMDb, only Breaking Bad (which I watched just before I started reviewing TV series), Avatar: The Last Airbender (it's great), and Game of Thrones (pre Season 8) are rated higher among fiction). It's a mob story set in late 90s New Jersey produced for HBO and has all the sex, violence, and language you'd expect from that combination. It's ... quite a show. Dealing with family, the moral complexity (at best) of mob life, and mental health issues... and that's just season 1. Oh it's a show. 

Some episodes particularly worth commenting on:

* Pilot: Starting the show out with therapy as a way to deal with the sex and violence (for the characters and the viewers) is a great way to set things up. 
* College: A collision between Tony's home and mob lives and daughter Meadow Soprano's introduction to the darker world. 
* Boca: How does the mob deal with a soccer coach they don't want to leave--and then things get darker. Mob and normal life rubbing against each other is great. 
* Isabella: Oh things really got complicated... family and mob are tied up in all sorts of terrible wonderful ways. 
* I Dream of Jeannie Cusamono: Continuing the previous plotline and another mob/life collision with friend Artie Bucco's restaurant. 

There's a reason this show is so highly rated and I can't wait to see where it goes from here. 

Warning: NSFW. Like... really NSFW. It's very HBO.
