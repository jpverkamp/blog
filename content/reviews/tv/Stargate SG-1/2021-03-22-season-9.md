And now we're really getting into the cast shake ups. Richard Dean Anderson has mostly moved on and the powers that be have finally realized the team needs a new lead: So we get Ben Browder as Lt. Colonel Cameron Mitchell. I wouldn't have minded Carter keeping the reigns and Bowder certainly isn't Anderson, but unlike the whole Jonas mess, he doesn't try to be. He's still a fairly straight laced military leader, but he's his own kind and I really like it. It works out pretty well.

We also get Claudi Black back as Vala for an increasingly big role as the season goes on, which I also appreciate. It's a bit weird having both Browder and Black after Fargate (on which they both starred), but it works. As I mentioned before, Black has wonderful chemistry with just about everyone, in particular Michael Shanks and is a fun addition to the team. 

On top of <i>all that</i>, we of course have to have a new big bad: the Ori. We had a few mentions of them before, but now they're back in force and really causing trouble. They're... a little too faceless and all powerful to be as good a villains as the goa'uld, but I think (just like a lot of changes for this season) they work in their own way. 

There are a few great episodes in this season. In particular: *The Ties That Bind*/*The Powers That Be* with Vala and Jackson synnergy, *Beachhead* showing off the Ori, *Ripple Effect* (Parallel realities! So many Carters!), and *Arthur's Mantle* (another parallel dimension story[^parallel]). 

Unfortunately there are also more than a few weird/weak episodes, such as *Babylon*/*Stronghold* (Jaffa) and *Collateral Damage* (it just seems out of place in this episode). 

I must admit, I'm not a huge fan of how hard they leaned on the Authurian myths for a lot of the anti-Ori plots. It makes some sense as a parallel to the goa'uld/impersonating gods thing, but it's just a lot weaker. Especially with the ancients having been gone for so very much longer from our Galaxy, it just doesn't work. 

So it goes. 

Still a great season and now only one to go before Atlantis! And a few movies. :) Man there's a lot of Stargate; isn't it wonderful?

[^parallel]:
    A wonderful exchange:

    > Mitchell: Out of phase? What does that mean?
    > 
    > Carter: It means we may have shifted to an alternate dimension.
    >
    > Mitchell: And there are an infinite number of alternate dimensions.
    > 
    > Carter: No no no. Thatâ€™s alternate realities.
    > 
    > Mitchell: So when the other SG-1 showed up?
    > 
    > Carter: Completely different problem.
