And so it ends. As expected, David and Patrick's wedding is a big storyline (and man David is neurotic when stressed), but we also have Alexis continuing to grow in relationships and work (which is such an amazing growth from Season 1), the whole hotel starting to grow (rapidly) and Moira doing Moira things. 

Overall, it's a good way to end the show. We have some ending up moving back to the lives they once had, hopefully a little more self aware (I doubt so in Moira's case...) from their time in Schitt's Creek. 

Not a show I normally would have chosen, but I'm glad to have watched it. Onward!

Ongoing thoughts (spoilers):

1.  Smoke Signals

    Moments have passed! Moira is nuts, Alexis is off to the Galapagos Islands, and David and Patrick are going to get married!

    > You mixed up the day and the month on your ticket again, - didn't you?

2.  The Incident

    > Patrick Brewer: David! It's okay!
    >
    > David Rose: It's not okay. Nothing about that is okay. Now you have to remake your little bed because I peed in it!
    >
    > Patrick Brewer: David, go and get in the shower. I will take care of this.
    >
    > David Rose: Does that window open? Because I'm about to jump out
    >
    > Patrick Brewer: David, I need the comforter.
    >
    > David Rose: Okay, but we must never speak of this again.
    >
    > Patrick Brewer: Okay. I love you!

    David Rose: I'm glad one of us does.

    How did that come up in the writerâ€™s room?

    Andâ€¦ Moira being Moira.

    Also: Hotel empire! Of course Roland is Rolanding.

3.  The Job Interview

    Ted the Turtle. That is all.

    Also Stevie vs. David; competitive job interview, go! That was amusing.

4. Maid of Honor

    The Crows movie is such a strange thing. 

    Yay growth from Alexis and Stevie!

    Alsoâ€¦ totally lying about the agent. 

5. The Premiere 

    Patrick is adorable on dentistry drugs. 

6. The Wingman

    Poor sad Bob? Bit of a weird plot. 

    Alexis weighing impressive career opportunities versus Tedâ€¦ oh, how theyâ€™ve grown. 

7. Moira RosÃ©

    Totally a cult. Totally too much wine. 

8. The Presidential

    Ted! Oh. Ted. Oh that was quite a way to go for that particular plot line. 

    Both Johnny and Roland (badly) imitating JFK was adorable. 

9. Rebound

    Moira has 6 episodes to redeem herself! Nah. 

    David seems stressed. 

    Alexis dating â€¦ a grandfather as a rebound. Thatâ€™s certainly a thing. 

10. Sunrise, Sunset

    David has expensive tastes. This shouldnâ€™t be a surprise. Johnny is so proud. Also not. 

    Also so many faces I recognize! Clifton Sparks and Saul Rubinek!

11. The Bachelor Party

    David is such a bridezilla. An escape room sounds like a terribly great idea. 

    The return of Larry Air!

12. The Pitch

    Thought theyâ€™d gotten over wanting to get out long ago. Moira causing trouble, Alexis makes sense, butâ€¦ why does David beed to leave?

13. Start Spreading the News

    Turns out Twyla is so not into it for the money. Thatâ€™s hilarious. 

    And Davidâ€¦ might be staying?

    And and the Jazzagals tearing up. Daw. 

14. Happy Ending

    ðŸŽµ It's like rain on your wedding day ðŸŽµ

    â€¦ oh. So thatâ€™s what the title also means. Oh Davidâ€¦

    What *is* Moira wearing. 

    And so it ends. Quite a show.
