So... that's a huge bummer. They swapped out most of the cast, kept one that... is a weird choice, and mostly changed the entire style of the show. It's a fascinating choice and I wanted to like it... but I just couldn't. Made it two episodes in. So it goes.

Mini-reviews for two episodes:

1. Phantom Lady 

    ... Poe?

    Michael Shanks is a fun surprise. Haven't seen him in a while. 

    > Poe: We just got here. 
    >
    > Kovacs: I didn't kill him. 
    >
    > Poe: What a refreshing change. 

    It certainly feels different. Like a different story based on the same world. But it has some potential. 

2. Payment Deferred

    A part dog/wolf sleeve? Word addition. 

    Kovacs yelling at Poe … is just wrong. :/

    Quell! Quell?

    Aw man. That Alpha Wolf stuff…
