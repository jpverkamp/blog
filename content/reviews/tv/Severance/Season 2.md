Whelp. They certainly turned *that* up a notch. 

Right at the end of Season 1, the innies get a chance to go out. This could not *possibly* go well...

Except apparently all is well in the world? 

Until... it's not. 

We have drama, both innie and outie and mixed. We have goats. We have sex scenes. We have wives cheating with their own husbands. We have a trip into the woods. 

And we have a marching band.

I quite enjoyed this show. 

And now I have to wait for season 3!!

# Severance S2


## 1. *Hello, Ms. Cobel*

Five months. 

New boss. New team. New Milchick. 

> Mark W: Why are you a child?
> Miss Huang: Because of when I was born.

Oh... this show is weird. 

Just kidding. Same old MDR. With stories. And lies. 

Oh... this show is weird. 

## 2. *Goodbye, Mrs. Selvig*

And now back to the night it all happened. 

> It was also very brave.  
> I'd hate to reward his courage with nonexistence. 

It's not huge forward momentum, but it does fill in some spots I was hoping to see. 

> Why did you do this?  
> What the fuck is this all about?

Man Mrs. Covelvig is a lot. 

## 3. *Who Is Alive?*

Goats. 

## 4. *Woe's Hollow*

And then they were outside. With weird pointing clones and hallucinations and a sex scene. 

And man the twists. 

This show just went several steps weirder and I'm not sure what to think about that. 

## 5. *Trojan's Horse*

And now Helly R. returns to work. Oh boy that's a mess. 

And Mark(s) are about to Mark. 

Oooh boy. 

## 6. *Atilla*

The scene with Dr. Walter Bishop from Fringe, Jesus from the Big Lebowski, and Christopher Walken was ... really something. 

And Mark's complicated relationship with Helly(s) just got me complicated. 

Oh. And brain surgery. 

Oh this show. 

## 7. *Chikhai Bardo*

Gemma. 

Gemmas. 

At least my theory that her outtie was dead between innie sessions doesn't seem to be the case. 

I'm ... not sure this is better. 

What in the *world* is Lumon doing?!

## 8. *Sweet Vitriol* 

So Harmony's history goes much further than I expected. 

A weird aside. 

## 9. *The After Hours*

Eggs. A promotion. Cheating. A hidden past. Harmony. Falling apart. Driven away. Resigning. Big words. Little words. Innocence. Bus. Train. Truck. What the fuck? 

Cold Harbor. 

Oh this show. 

One more!

## 10. *Cold Harbor*

Marks' conversation was certainly a scene. 

And then... the Marching Band[^band][^band2][^band3]

And then... Mammalian Offerings. With verve. And wiles. 

And then... Gemma/Helly. Does Mark S. have the slightest plan for what in the world can he do next?


[^band]: So... (in universe). How did they find the band? How did they practice? What do they know?! 

[^band2]: And given how they react to bathroom Milchick... are they even self aware? Are they real?

[^band3]: So... they can react to things. Are they *all* severed?
