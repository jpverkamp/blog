Well, that's quite a show. 

At first glance, the idea is appealing. You split your memories so that you can go to work, get paid, and essentially spend your entire life *not at work*. 

But then you start to think about this other you. 

They never leave. 

They never sleep. 

They never have a life outside of work. 

And that--is terrifying enough even before you start getting into the whole cult'y aspects. And the hallways. And the goats. 

I have no idea where they're going--(I hope they know)--but I'm looking forward to it. Onward!

## 1. *Good News About Hell*

Five questions. 

Crying in a car. 

Going down. 

A *lot* of hallways.

Macrodata Refinement. 

More hallways. 

Leave. Stay. Leave. Stay. Leave. Stay. 

Watching her watch her. 

> [reading calmly into camera]  
> Helly Riggs: My name is Helly R. I'm making this video roughly two hours before it will be shown .. to me.  
> Helly Riggs: I have, of my own free accord, elected to undergo the procedure colloquially known as Severance. I give consent for my perceptual chronologies to be surgically split, separating my memories between my work life and my personal life. I acknowledge that, henceforth, my access to my memories will be spatially dictated. I will be unable to access outside recollections whilst on Lumon's severed basement floor, nor retain work memories upon my ascent.  
> Helly Riggs: I am aware that this alteration is comprehensive and irreversible.  

Pip's VIP. 

Helly!

A dinner party. Without dinner. Ricken... is weird. 

A businessman in the night. Maybe. 

Housework. 

Petey. 

This... is going to be a show. 

## 2. *Half Loop*

Oh hey. The "before" perspective. 

Oh. Hey. Brain surgery. 

The realization that the worker half doesn't get to sleep. Ever. 

And quitting is suicide. 

Certainly something. 

The drunk philosophical debate was amusing. 

> Mark: The fyck is that?
> Petey: That's the break room. 

And then Christopher Walken. 

> Helly: They were scary. The numbers were scary. 

## 3. *In Perpetuity*

So... other than the fact that we literally see them there's really no way for Innie Mark to have any proof whatsoever that Outie Mark actually exists. 

Petey is a lot. Neighbor/boss boss lady is a lot. This show is a lot. The board is a lot. Or possibly not. It's hard to tell. Milchick is a *lot*. 

> It's really easier on you both if he knows which end to start with. 

...

> I mean I'm 99% sure there was no coup. 

...

> Seems like they'd recognize my face. Maybe if you wore it inside out. 

...

This is most certainly a show. 

## 4. *The You You Are*

Another level of the warped Severance is: you can take "break", go home, and immediately go back. Again and again. You don't even get time to sleep or eat. 

> Helly: I could not, with a razor to my throat, be less interested in being your family.

Speaking of which...

Oh my goodness the Hellys. That is quite the video to oneself. 

## 5. *The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design*

> What separates man from machine is that machines cannot think for themselves. Also, they are made of metal, whereas man is made of skin. 

This show is a lot. 

Ricken is a lot. 

And that's not even to mention the Hellys plot. I wonder if/when we'll get to meet her outie. 

And then... goats. 

This show is a lot. 

## 6. *Hide and Seek*

So... a shrine. She's bonkers. 

This show is bonkers. 

Christopher Walken is in the first (not!) romantic scenes in the show... not what I expected. 

This show is now what I expected. 

Hatchets. 

They... can remotely sever switch. 

> What in the fuckity fuck?

Exactly. 

## 7. *Defiant Jazz*

A swing.... and a hit!

> Should have gone for the castanets. 

That... was an Experience. 

And that ending. Who is it? Who IS IT? WHO... 

Oh my. 

## 8. *What's for Dinner?*

So that's Outie Irv. 

And that's the plan. 

And that's a kiss. 

And that's a Waffle Party. 

## 9. *The Way We Are*

Innies Out. 

That's... such an insane twist. Twists. So many twists.
