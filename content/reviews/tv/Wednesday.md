Oh that's a delight of a show. 

> They're creepy and they're kooky  
> Mysterious and spooky  
> They're all together ooky  
> The Addams family  

An entire show with the dark worldbuilding and humor of the Addams family, focusing around Wednesday (my favorite)? Yes please. 

The [casting](#casting) is great--especially Jenna Ortega as the lead and Emma Myers as Enid. A delightful pairing. 

The mystery vibe is on point (and it's right up to the end before you know *for sure* who the baddies are). 

The setting is fun--even if the 'outcasts' of Nevermore seem curiously non-magical a lot of the times. And then in the big final numbers, we go full on magic--which also felt surprisingly weird for the Addams family. ut it works well enough. 

Oh, I'm looking forward to season 2.

## Casting

The casting on this show was *so fun*. Worth another look. 

Jenna Ortegaâ€™s Wednesday Addams. Wonderfully Wednesday. 

Catherine Zeta-Jones looks odd as Morticia. Iâ€™m not really sure why. 

Luis GuzmÃ¡n is a great Gomez. Not quite Raul Julia, but I like it. 

Gwendoline Christie is delightful as the Principal Larissa Weems. She was wasted in Star Wars. 

Emma Myers as Enid Sinclair is a *delight*. I do love the contrast with Wednesday. 

Riki Lindhome as Dr. Valerie Kinbott makes a surprisingly good therapist.

And finally (takes a bit for him to show up); Fester! Itâ€™s not Christopher Lloyd (that was Christopher Lloyd!), but man Fred Armisen plays him so well. 

## Episode by episode review

Potential spoilers; particularly for previous episodes. 

### 1. *Wednesdayâ€™s Child is Full of Woe*

> Monday's child is fair of face,
> Tuesday's child is full of grace.
> Wednesday's child is full of woe,
> Thursday's child has far to go.
> Friday's child is loving and giving,
> Saturday's child works hard for a living.
> And the child born on the Sabbath day
> Is bonny and blithe, good and gay.

ðŸ˜ƒ

> But the four main cliques are Fangs, Furs, Stoners, and Scales. 

What about everyone else? 

The fencing scene reminds me a lot of the 1991 film. ðŸ˜„ 

The cello Paint it Black? Delightful. Apparently Ortega learned to play it herself? Shiny. 

I am rather jealous of Wednesday and Edinâ€™s room. 

Thing flipping Tyler off? Hilarious. 

The monster in the woods: kind of silly looking. I hope/expect theyâ€™ll explain that? 

### 2. *Woe is the Loneliest Number*

>  Wednesday Addams: Yes, I know that I am stubborn, obsessive and single-minded. Those are all traits of great writers
> [Thing gesticulates pointedly]
> Wednesday Addams: Yes, and serial killers too. What's your point

Oh, itâ€™s so fun seeing Wednesday come into her own. 

Even if her own involves a murder sheâ€™s sure she sawâ€¦ even if the victim is still up and wondering around. 

And the school rivalry / supporting Enid? Excellent. I love the boat race scene. Wednesday actually doing social thingsâ€¦ Wednesday style. I want more of Nevermore, even if she still doesnâ€™t. 

> Enid Sinclair: Admit it! You kinda got into the whole school spirit thing.
> Wednesday Addams: You didn't tell me it was a dark, vengeful spirit.

### 3. *Friend or Woe*

> Wednesday Addams: This story is about to take a dark turn. Usually I love dark turns, like when the carousel brakes mysteriously failed at my eighth birthday party.

Oh Wednesday. Doing what she feels is rightâ€¦ no matter what. 

I love the montage towards the end of the episode where we get a shot of everyoneâ€”anyone could be the monster!

>  Tyler Galpin: Don't tell me you were a Girl Scout.
> Wednesday Addams: I could eat Girl Scouts for breakfast. Actually, I have an uncle who went to prison for that.

I do love the references to the films!

### 4. *Woe What a Night*

>  Sheriff Donovan Galpin: Why would I share information about an ongoing murder investigation with a high school kid?
> Wednesday Addams: Because I go the Nevermore and you don't. Don't you want some eyes and ears behind those ivy-covered walls?
> Sheriff Donovan Galpin: Listen, Velma, why don't you and the Scooby gang stick to your homework and leave the investigating to the professionals?

Iâ€™m quite enjoying the scenes between the Sheriff and Wednesday far more than I expected. 

Oh, and the dance scene. I suppose thereâ€™s a reason it was all over YouTube. And of course, the full on {{<spoiler>}}Carrie{{</spoiler>}} scene. Not just Addams family references after all!

I do find it interesting that the Nevermore students freak out about creepy stuff. I suppose even monsters have a range of creepy to â€˜normalâ€™. Still surprises me each time I see it; Wednesday is the weirdo among weirdos. Iâ€™m okay with this. 
 
### 5. *You Reap What You Woe*

Parent night! 

Oh, Wednesdayâ€™s relationship with her parentsâ€”and the mysteries of a murder years agoâ€¦ Pugsley and Wednesdayâ€™s relationship is fascinating as well.  

> Pugsley: I always thought I'd be the first one in the family behind bars.
> Wednesday: Lurch and I had a bet going.

Oh, Enidâ€™s relationship with her parents (mostly her mother). Poor Enid. Quite the â€˜conversion therapyâ€™ analogue they have going on there. I do wonder how thatâ€™s going to end up. 

### 6. *Quid Pro Woe*

> Wednesday: What part of "no party under the penalty of death" do you not understand?

Oh, itâ€™s so fun to see Wednesday having friendsâ€¦ and sheâ€™s so clueless about it all. 

> Tyler: Come on. Don't you like a day that's all about you?
> Wednesday: Every day is all about me. This one just comes with cake and a bad song

Love triangle to be? A little weirder. ðŸ˜ƒ

### 7. *If You Donâ€™t Woe Me by Now*

Fester! 

> Uncle Fester: Your dad got all the brains. But I used to drop in on him. Usually from the ceiling with a dagger clutched between my teeth. Just to keep him on his toes.

Itâ€™s not Christopher Lloyd (that was Christopher Lloyd!), but man Fred Armisen plays him so well. 

Also, SO MANY THINGS HAPPENING! 

Enid? {{<spoiler>}}ðŸ˜¢{{</spoiler>}}

Tyler {{<spoiler>}}and picnic in a crypt{{</spoiler>}}? {{<spoiler>}}ðŸ˜ƒ{{</spoiler>}}

Thing? {{<spoiler>}}ðŸ˜±{{</spoiler>}}

### 8. *A Murder of Woes*

And here it all comes together.

{{<spoiler>}}Christina Ricci{{</spoiler>}} being the bigger bad all alone? *chefâ€™s kiss*

That... was quite a bit more magic than I expected--or than we'd seen up until now. Feels weird for the Addams family. But it works. 

They did the mystery â€˜it could be anyone!â€™ thing pretty well. 

> Wednesday Addams: [Last lines] Unlike my novel, not every thread has been tied up, not every question answered. Secrets are still lurking in the dark corners of Jericho. Were {{<spoiler>}}Laurel Gates{{</spoiler>}} and {{<spoiler>}}Tyler{{</spoiler>}} just pawns in a bigger game? Will today's stalker become tomorrow's nemesis? I know the suspense is killing you.
