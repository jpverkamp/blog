> John Locke: [screaming] What am I supposed to do?

And so my third watch of Lost continues!

Season 1 was all about the crash on the island. About survival, with only the beginnings of weirdness around the edges. 

In Season 2? Now we're really getting into it. 

In *Orientation*, we get our first hints of the Hatch. Desmond is such a fun character, even if (*spoilers*!) he's not in as much of this seasons as later ones. And oh, later on, we have *Lockdown*. Now *that* is a wonderful mystery of an episode. And the whole season does have an excellent dynamic between Jack and Locke. Man of Science. Man of Faith. (And really, which is which?)

> John Locke: Why do you find it so hard to believe?!
> 
> Jack Shephard: Why do you find it so easy?!
> 
> John Locke: It's never been easy!

We get a few new characters from the tail section (*The Other 48 Days*). Mr. Eko is such an intense foil to Locke in particular. And the 

We do also get two amazing Hugo backstory centered episodes: *Everybody Hates Hugo* and *Dave*. 

> Hugo: Did either of you see a bald guy in slippers with a coconut come through here?
> 
> Charlie: No. But I did see a polar bear on roller skates with a mango.” 

He's such a fun character, in spite (because?) of everything. 

In *Maternity Leave*, we get a bit more about the medical mystery. 

And then in the end... we *Live Together, Die Alone*. 

Oh, I'm looking forward to Season 3!
