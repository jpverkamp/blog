Survival. Mysteries. The Others.

And now, just possibly... rescue? 

But, as they said in the end of the previous season, it's *not Penny's boat*. 

So who's is it? 

I really enjoy this season. We get a chance to have some new characters (from the freighter come to rescue them), a bit of a shake up in terms of who's on which side on th island, and a whole pile of 'what is even going on', split a bit between Desmond and newcomer Daniel Faraday--I do enjoy his character. 

Overall, we really are starting to get into the point where you question 'so... were they planning that all along? do even the *writers* know what's going on?'

And ... I'm pretty sure the answer is no? That doesn't mean it's a bad season though!

And, because of the 2008 writer's strike, it's a shorter season as well> Ramps of the tension that. 

Favorite episodes this season? 

The first flashes off the island--with their own level of *you did **what** now. *The Constant*, with timey-whimey shenanigans and *There's No Place Like Home*, with everything coming to a tense, sometimes magical, and always chaotic end. 

It's interesting seeing Lost straddle the line between science fiction and more supernatural/fantasy. I tend to like the former, but a lot of times, it's the contrast that really does the best. 

Only two seasons left! 

Onward!
