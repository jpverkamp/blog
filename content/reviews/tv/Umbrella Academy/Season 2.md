Well that was quite a continuation. Out of one apocalypse and right into another. This time in the 1960s!

It's a neat concept and gives the characters a bit more time to grow--while at the same time the viewers know there's quite the timeline. And with time travel... you can kill people off and still have to deal with them. 

Also instead of Hazel and Cha-Chat, you have three Swedish brothers (less amusing, far more terrifying). 

I quite enjoyed it. And there's still *plenty* of room left for Season 3. A quick search shows February 2022... I'm going to go with a probably not on that. But still soon!

Episode by episode thoughts--definitely a few spoilers, but with how much everything twists and turns and changes... that may not be as huge a deal as in some shows. :

1. *Right Back Where We Started*

    > What the hell did we do?

    That is one glorious opening. Dropped off scattered throughout time, then everyone is fully powered up, and finally realize things have gone waaaay sideways. Beautiful.

2. *The Frankel Footage*

    She's BACK! And ... he's got a fish in a tank for a head. AND… {{<spoiler>}}Hargreeves!{{</spoiler>}}. This is quite a show.

3. *The Swedish Job*

    Of course everyone is involved. And meeting Vanya goes well. Of course.

4. *The Majestic 12*

    Poor Klaus. Poor Allison. Poor Vanya. Poor Luther. Poor Diego. Poor everyone.

5. *Valhalla*

    Seeing the origin of Pogo is pretty cool!

    Also the family is all coming together!

    Man the music in this show in general is great. This show in specifically. A great arrangement of _Bad Guy_ and Swedish _Hello_ (which totally fits).

6. *A Light Supper*

    Dinner with dad. I'm sure this will go well.

    > I heard a rumor you punched yourself in the face.

    The heart to heart with Five was ... fascinating.

7. *Öga for Öga*

    And then there was one…

    Also a way out which of course fails. Good times. 

8. *The Seven Stages*

    Fives! And it was Vanya all along. 

    Oh eating brains… this show…

    > I really wish I had time for the nervous breakdown you so deserve. 

9. *743*

    > The Handler: Darling, blood is thicker than water. But you can drown in either.

    They … fixed everything? Maybe? 

    Pretty sure each fix makes things worse. Oh that ending though. 

10. *The End of Something*

    Have they learned *nothing*… Oh. Maybe there is hope after all. 

    Also:

    > On the 12th hour of the first day of October 1989, 43 women around the world gave birth.
    >
    > This was unusual only in the fact that none of these women had been pregnant when the day first began.
    >
    > Sir Reginald Hargreeves, eccentric billionaire and adventurer, resolved to locate and adopt as many of the children as possible.

    *43* women. Right! And they managed to mess things up even more. Looking forward to season 3!
