Oh that's quite a show. After {{<crosslink text="reading through the graphic novels" title="The Umbrella Academy, Vol. 1: The Apocalypse Suite">}}, it's a rather different experience. The core is the same, even if details are a bit different.

Colm Feore as Reginald Hargreeves is my favorite casting. He reminds me as Michael Douglas as Dr. Hank Pym in Ant-Man.

Onward to season 2!

Thoughts, episode by episode--potential spoilers:

1. We Only See Each Other at Weddings and Funerals

    Well that's quite a cast. Super powered super team? Super corrupt and somehow... human.

    The dance party was ridiculous... but given their somewhat--complicated--upbringing... it works. Hilarious and awesome to watch.

2. Run Boy Run

    Oh Klaus... He's absolutely bonkers. It's pretty spectacular.

    It's been long enough that I only vaguely remember what actually ended the world... but if it's the same, I can totally see it coming.

3. Extra Ordinary

    I take it back. Klaus isn't the crazy one. They're all the crazy one. Man they're all messed up.

    Poor Vanya.

    Poor Klaus?

4. Man on the Moon

    Weird animal mask secret agents dance party go?

    Oh Klaus, how thou hast embraced thine madness.

5. Number Five

    Right... that's what Number Five was up to in the future and what's with Hazel and Cha-Cha. It's all coming back to me... and all coming together.

    > [ice cream truck chimes playing "Ride of the Valkaries"]

    I love subtitles sometimes.

6. The Day That Wasn't

    Or--'what happened to Klaus'.

    And then time travel happened. Again.

    Quite a last minute!

7. The Day That Was

    One moment—or a lifetime of moments—that’s all it takes to make a villain.

    > Allison: Do you have any idea how insane this sounds?
    > 
    > Five: You know what else is insane?
    > 
    > I look like a 13-year-old boy.
    > 
    > Klaus talks to the dead, and Luther thinks he's fooling everybody with that overcoat.
    > 
    > Everything about us is insane.
    > 
    > It always has been.

    Of course {{<spoiler>}}Harold is Leonard {{</spoiler>}}. Oh boy. Luther on a freedom binge and Klaus just trying to do the right thing. A (super)family.

    > Klaus: Wh... What? What are you saying?
    > 
    > Reginald Hargreeves: The only way to get you all back together was something... momentous.

    ... oof. And it totally fits. 

    And of course Hazel and Cha-Cha:

    > We have a great job. The best job. We get to visit exotic places, meet new people, and then kill 'em.

8. I Heard a Rumor

    Oh… that was a terrible thing to make one young girl do to another. Just as the boys are coming together, everything falls apart.

    He knew. All along he knew. All that rage.

9. Changes

    > Where has it gotten me? Nowhere.
    > 
    > I can't talk to the person I love. People... still don't take me seriously.
    > 
    > I wanna be numb again.

    Oh Klaus. He's really the most interesting character in this show, and that's saying something. 

    > Five: I'm not an addict. 
    > 
    > Klaus: Yeah, you are. You're addicted to a drug called the apocalypse.

    And now the pieces are all in place. effect is cause, revenge is coming.

10. The White Violin

    Time cop boss is terrifying. Vanya is terrifying. The end of the world is coming.

    > What's the worst that can happen?
    > 
    > You're lookin' at it. A 58-year-old man inside a child's body.

    Quite a first season. Glad there’s already a second!
