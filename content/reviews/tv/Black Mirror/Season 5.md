A whole series in three episodes? Whee! 

It's interesting how the three episodes are at once similar and so different. There's little enough radically different technology--mostly extrapolations of what we have now or may expect to have soon--but it's done well. 

And even with just three, we already have one that's a straight forward exploration, one that's more of a slow burn, and one that has a sudden sharp escalation. 

A lot to fit into a short season. 

Onward!

Episode by episode reviews (potential minor spoilers):

{{<toc>}}

## 1. *Striking Vipers*

Fighting games and virtual reality. Where you feel everything. What could possibly go wrong. 

Nope. That’s not the way it goes. 

Yup. That’s the one. 

Normal enough problems with a touch of tech; what Black Mirror does. 

## 2. *Smithereens*

Social media. Addictive personalities and apps designed to be as addictive as absolutely possible. 

That’s… quite an episode. A sort of over intense slow burn. 

## 3. *Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too*

Grieving. The contrast of everyday life and a popstar’s life. And AI. Because with Black Mirror, of course there is AI. 

Casting Miley Cyrus as ‘Miley Cyrus’. I enjoyed that. 

The second half, with Ashley Too too? Delightful.
