Onward we go!

Only barely long than season 2, it still manages to pack quite a bunch. We have the [prescient one (given all the news about LLMs/AIs)](#1-be-right-back), the [one where the world's ended](#2-white-bear) (or may be a world has ended), the [politics are stupid--ha ha--one](#3-the-waldo-moment), and the [twisted and all connected one](#4-white-christmas). 

This is quite the show. How did I miss this? 

I'm looking forward to season 2!

{{<toc>}}

## 1. *Be Right Back*

Well chalk that right up to "Black Mirror came true" with all the LLM AIs recently. Cheerful. 

I found the {{<spoiler>}}pregnancy{{</spoiler>}} a bit much, not going to lie. 

But otherwise, it’s an exploration of an entirely too possible future. 

Oy. 

## 2. *White Bear*

Well that’s one heck of an intense opening… the silence. The confusion. Oy. 

And then the twists. I will admit, I did not see that coming—something was up, everyone was just too clean and contained. But seriously, oy.

Twisted. 

Excellent. 

## 3. *The Waldo Moment*

> Employee: We should probably just shift before this turns stupid.

> Mr. Monroe: I’m not walking away from a cartoon.

Perhaps you should have. 

And then you get blue animated bear for politics. 

## 4. *White Christmas*

Pick up artist guide? What could possibly go wrong? 

Oh. 

AI assistant setup assistant? What could…

Oh. 

The ability to block people in real life? 

Oh. 

… wait. 

Well that’s a cheerful way to celebrate Christmas…
