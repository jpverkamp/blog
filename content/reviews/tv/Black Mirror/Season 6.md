Oh hey, I'm all caught up!

I actually watched *Joan is Awful* on accident a while back and that's really the highlight of the season. The problems with generative AI written perhaps a little too large, but that's what Black Mirror *does*. 

Other than that, this is really getting more into horror anthology territory, which I'm not sure what to think about. I'll still catch Season 7 if/when it's out, but it's a bit less sure than I used to be.

Episodes:

{{<toc>}}


## 1. *Joan is Awful*

> Joan: Letâ€™s see whatâ€™s on Streamberry. 
> (Netflix sounds)
> (S with the Netflix logo style appears)

Iâ€™m amused. 

And then mildly horrifying. 

And then increasingly horrifying. 

The story of your lifeâ€”but when youâ€™re not a good person. 

The future of AI. 

Alsoâ€¦

> Salma Hayekâ€™s Lawyer: Uhâ€¦ Salma Hayekâ€™s anus. 

That is all. 

> Salma Hayekâ€™s Lawyer: Up to, including, and beyond defection. 

Nope. It gets better.

> Salma Hayek: Let's kill this quam-*puta*.

## 2. *Loch Henry*

I feel like weâ€™ve  seen this rolling country roads before in this showâ€¦ ðŸ˜„ 

> Itâ€™s like something from a painting.
> Thatâ€™s because people paint landscapes. 

And of courseâ€¦ a local history of MURDER. 

The ending did not go where I expectedâ€”but not in a particularly great way this time I donâ€™t think. 

## 3. *Beyond the Sea*

Another one of those with actors I recognize! Happens more with different casts in each episode. 

Life and death. From afar. 

Iâ€™m â€¦ not sure at all why they didnâ€™t have a better plan in place for the one left behind. 

Once things get going though, I think you can expect where itâ€™s all going to go. Still quite well done to get there though. 

{{<spoiler>}}Okay, I didnâ€™t quite guess the endingâ€¦ oy. Now what?{{</spoiler>}}

{{<spoiler>}}Speaking of whichâ€¦ itâ€™s interesting we never really know anything about what the mission is about.{{</spoiler>}}

{{<spoiler>}}Alsoâ€¦ the anti-tech cult from the beginning never coming back was an interesting choice.{{</spoiler>}}

## 4. *Mazey Day*

{{<youtube "d2smz_1L2_0">}}

But of course, this is Black Mirror. It canâ€™t be that easyâ€¦

Short. Intense. 

More questions than answers. 

I feel like weâ€™re getting away from the commentary on technology deep into a more fantasy/horror bent. And I like it well enough, but itâ€™s not *really* what I liked most about early Black Mirror. 

## 5. *Demon 79*

Well that's just downright supernatural. Accidentally summon a demon, told you have to murder to save the world. Now what? 

It's a cute story, but we've gotten a long way from the problems with tech I really liked Black Mirror for.
