Been meaning to watch this for years. Finally got around to it. 

It's interesting; especially for only have three episodes in the first season. 

[The first episode](#1-the-national-anthem) is kind of weird and by far the least 'sci-fi' of the bunch--this could happen now. 

[The second](#2-fifteen-million-merits) though starts out as fairly straight forward near future dystopia and then goes *dark* from there. I like it. 

And [the third](#3-the-entire-history-of-you)--take a concept (recording everything), apply the concept to imperfect (honestly fairly terrible) people and see what breaks. It's great. 

I'm looking forward to season 2!

## 1. *The National Anthem*

> This is virgin territory Prime Minister. There is no playbook. 

Well, that's certainly one way to put it. 

[They had to know](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piggate), right?

It's kind of amazing for next to nothing happening, how intense it all is. And how there's no real reason for it all in the end. 

Quite a place to start. Bit weird. I was expecting something a bit more sci-fi. 

## 2. *Fifteen Million Merits*

Ah. That's the dystopian sci-fi I was expecting from this show. 

An entire life built around riding bikes and watching ads. And a once in a lifetime chance to compete at a singing competition? 

Nope. Far more sinister than that. 

## 3. *The Entire History of You*

Perfect shareable memory. It would be great to remember more sometimes... but of course this is the perfect darker mirror of what could be. (black even :D)

I don't think perfect memory is really the issue here...
