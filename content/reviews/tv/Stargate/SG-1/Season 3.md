The good/great:

*Fair Game*: Negotiating with the Goa'uld with Asgard as mediators!

*Legacy*: A typical 'maybe you were crazy all along' episode!

*Point of View*: More alternate realities!

*Foothold*: Aliens in the SGC!

*Urgo*: "Comtraya!" A wonderful episode. 

*A Hundred Days*: It's kind of hilarious how often O'Neill gets stranded and finds love... Still a touching story. I just want him to be happy. 

*Crystal Skull*: I love this episode and Daniel's grandfather is hilarious. Unfortunately this is also one of the weaknesses of Stargate: Sometimes we get cool plot points (the giant aliens) that just never come up again. So it goes. Perhaps in the novels?

*Nemesis*: REPLICATORS! The early replicators are perfectly terrifying and the idea that the Asguard need someone dumber (and that humans are just that dumb(er)) is so perfect. 

On the weaker side, we have: 

*Demons*: The episodes that try to deal with Christianity are always weaker. The timeline just doesn't work as well as the otherwise ancient Gods.

That's really it. This is a really good season.
