Great episodes: *2001* (echoes of *2010* from last season), *Wormhole X-Treme!* (the parody episode to end all parody episodes), *Summit*/*Last Stand* (Goa'uld politics! A new bigger bad?!)

Less great episodes: *Threshold* (Jaffa weirdness and Teal'c defection didn't last nearly long enough), *Beast of Burden* (we did this already)

Towards the end, we do get one interesting bit of shake up with the {{< spoiler >}}death of Daniel Jackson. Of course it's not the first time{{< /spoiler >}}, but I imagine that for anyone watching this in real time, that was quite the shake up. 

In general, a stronger season than Season 4, but still not quite the hard hitting episodes from the beginning.
