Another great seasons. 

Good episodes: *Small Victories* (Replicators!), *Upgrades* (SG-1 on PCP!), *Divide and Conquer* (oh O'Neill and Carter...), and *2010* (time travel!)

Not as great: *Crossroads* (Jaffa episodes) and *Entity* (we've done this before). 

The Best of the Best: *Window of Opportunity*. Groundhog Day done Stargate style. It's absolutely wonderful and the only episode I'll just randomly watch out of order.

Overall, it's a fairly middling seasons. It's still a great show, but (other than *Window of Opportunity*), a general dearth of amazing. So it goes. Onward!
