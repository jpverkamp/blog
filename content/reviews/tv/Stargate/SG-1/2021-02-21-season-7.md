Daniel Jackson is back! (they could have done rather a bit more with re-integrating him I think)

The beginning of the search for Atlantis! (it's amusing, if a bit annoying how long that takes)

Stronger episodes: *Lifeboat* (Michael Shanks can really act; the plot is weird and weak but the acting is pretty dang impressive), *Heroes* (Oy. Just Oy. It's a slow burn, but very very good), *Lost City( (woo the beginning of Atlantis! on man that battle scene!)

Weaker episodes: *Fragile Balance* (it's a fun idea, but mostly just awkward), *Orpheus* (Teal'c has to deal injury and Tritonin; I see why they did it, but it's mostly annoying), *Avenger 2.0* (Felger is annoying and it weakens the world building to believe something like this isn't used all the time), *Resurrection* (one of the 'on Earth' episodes and not a good one), *Inauguration* (likewise)

That is one **heck** of an ending, making up for a spate of seasons where it feels like things aren't really going anywhere. And it gave us Atlantis! In previous viewings, I mixed SG-1 and Atlantis as they had aired, but I think I'll finish SG-1 first this time. But man, that battle at the end, with SG-1 on a wild goose chase to save the day and *Hammond* himself in {{< spoiler >}}to save the in the Prometheus{{< /spoiler >}}. Ooh, that's good.
