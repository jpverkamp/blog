Things are getting shaken up yet again. O'Neill is the big boss now and isn't going on missions any more, leaving SG-1 down a member. Dr. Weir has a new face (Torri Higginson); who will continue the role in Atlantis is kind of weird, but knowing already how well she did there, it's hard to see it any other way. Anubis is gone for the moment and the Goa'uld are in disarray. It's a bit of a weird season overall, but things really pick up in the second half with a number of old threats all gaining ground at the same time in one big what could have been series finale. 

Awesome episodes: *Prometheus Unbound* (Vala! (Claudia Black); man she and Shanks have wonderful chemistry), *Reckoning* (Lord Ba'al[^rip]!), *Threads* (Ascended beings and big twists!), *Moebius* (time travel and alternate realities!). 

Weak episodes: *Sacrifices* (Jaffa and Teal'c family)

Man that season ended strong. From what I've read, it could have been the end of the series and it would have worked. But I'm glad it wasn't. I actually really enjoyed the changes coming up!

[^rip]: May Cliff Simon rest in peace, man that was weird timing. He was such an amazing villain.
