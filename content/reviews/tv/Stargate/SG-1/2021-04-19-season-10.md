Whoo boy. And so it ends. It's a different sort of excellent from the peak of early SG-1, but the new team is really gelling, the Ori are a decent new threat, and it's quite a ride to go out on. Not all shows end so well. I'm happy with this. 

Excellent episodes: <b>The Pegasus Project</b>, crossover with Atlantis! <b>200</b>, the best parody episode ever. <b>The Quest: Part 1/2</b>, a big team up with SG-1, Ba'al, and even eventually Adria, off to find a magic doodad--plus, a dragon! <b>The Road Not Taken</b>, more parallel world shenanigans! <b>The Shroud</b>, Daniel as a prior!

Weaker episodes: Against the grain, but I didn't care for <b>Counterstrike</b>. It's a neat episode but a bit much Jaffa politics. <b>Family Ties</b>, Vala's father is overdone. But really, if those are the weakest, it's still a great final season. 

And of course, there is <b>Unending</b>. Just the core team, decades long montages, time dilation/time travel, and techno babble. It's a wonderful episode, easily among my top ten favorite episodes in the series and truly a worthy end* to the series. 

*Okay, so it's not the end. There are two direct-to-video movies yet before I go on to Atlantis and then Universe. Onward!
