The first big shake up of the main SG-1 cast. For better or for worse (or for out of universe negotiating reasons), Daniel Jackson is no longer part of SG-1 (or, truly, this mortal plane), so instead we have Jonas: who's basically a carbon copy of Daniel Jackson, but without all the history. I think he absolutely did a great job--and props to Corin Nemec for pulling that off--but I really wish that they could have done something a little more different since they were already shaking things up.

Great episodes: *Descent* (Jacob Carter, the team abandoned without support), *Frozen* (Ancients!), *Prometheus*/*Memento* (I love seeing the massive jumps in human tech), *Unnatural Selection* (more Replicators! bigger bads!), *Sight Unseen* (a surprisingly good Earth episode, one of the few cases where the Stargate secret really truly feels like it's almost revealed), and *Full Circle (see below)

Less great: *Redemption* (I still don't care for the Jaffa arcs and the slow build of Anubis' weapon is hard to build tension around), *Nightwalkers* (don't care as much for Earth episodes), *The Other Guys* (it's just too awkward for me)

Say what you will about Jonas, but *Full Circle* and the return of now-glowing Daniel Jackson is a pretty awesome episode. It's the first time we really get a sense for how much bigger a problem Anubis is.
