Well. That is most definitely a show.

Ava is an entitled 25 year old with basically no filter. Deborah Vance is Las Vegas comedian that might just be at the end of her career (certainly not by choice). 

And now they have to work together. 

What could possibly go wrong? 

There are some hilarious moments in this show. And I do really love Jean Smart as Deborah Vance. Hannah Einbinder as Ava Daniels is *so* cringe at times (no filter!), but *that's the point*. 

And the dynamic between the two is *fascinating*.

Carl Clemons-Hopkins as Marcus provides quite the B plot as very gay and very much running things for Deborah. 

And finally Paul W. Downs as Jimmy and Megan Stalter as Kayla... I could do with less of that. I guess you have to have someone keeping things moving? 

It's, I think, a show surprisingly worth watching. Onward to season 2!

Thoughts episode by episode. These aren't really reviews so much as thoughts as I watched it. I don't promise these will make the least bit of sense. In fact, I expect quite the opposite. 

Also, some NSFW language. It's that sort of show...

Good luck.

## 1. *There Is No Line*

Pentatonix. But apparently they couldn't/wouldn't get the 'real' Pentatonix on the screen? All righty then!

> Dickless snake

Do... snakes have dicks?

> Don't make your dead father a liar, Jimmy.

Exactly.

> What the fuck just happened?

That... pretty much sums up this entire show. 

## 2. *Primm*

> Honey, when you're on shuffle, any song can play at any moment and it is through that randomness that we can totally receive meaning.

That's... pretty much this show so far. 

> Hm.  
> Is that a good hm?  
> No.  

I love their dynamic. 

> And I realized that I could connect more emotionally with women, which led to deeper sexual experiences. But sometimes I do still need penetrative sex with a dick to come.  
> ...  
> ...  
> Jesus Christ! I was just wondering why you were dressed like Rachel Maddow's mechanic.  

Ava has *no* filter...

> You have to be so much more than good.  
> And even if you're great and lucky, you still have to work really fucking hard!  
> And even that is not enough. You have to scratch and claw, and it never fucking ends.   
> And it doesn't get better.  

You know. She has a point. 

## 3. *A Gig's a Gig*

Each of these episodes... I have to double check I didn't accidentally switch shows? 

Pizza. 

> Just glad my grandfather isn't around to see me help some white girl make passive income.

Oh Marcus. 

Man. She's mean. 

And then it ends with such potential. 

## 4. *D'Jewelry*

> It's like watching Picasso sing.  
> You mean paint?  
> No.  

So that's Kaitlin Olson as DJ Vance. 

Oh they have quite the relationship. 

(Also, she's Dee in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. You're welcome.)

> Well, they say if you collect, it's not a problem; it's a hobby.  
> Well, the first step is admitting you have a hobby.  



## 5. *Falling*

> Ohh, you're that girl who never got to sit with the cool kids at the lunch table, and she just never got over it.

Ouch. Also yes. 

> Uh, here's another toothpaste.  
> ...  
> That was so awkward. I feel bad.  

Ava has *no* filter. 

And then... death. Well that was more than a bit of whiplash. Oh this show. 

## 6. *New Eyes*

> Okay, good, call me if she starts acting weird, okay?  
> Okay, great. I'll--I'll let you know if she says anything nice about me.  
> You funny lady, too.  
> I take care of you when you get your chin fixed.

Funny lady. Also, not a joke. 

Of all the ways to unlock a phone. 

> What is wrong with you?  
> A lot.  

Yes. 

Sooooo many drugs in this show.

> People would want to hear this, okay?  
> People either want raw honesty or fuckin' ASMR videos of girls eating soap.  

That's just like... your opinion man. 

## 7. *Tunnel of Love*

Well that was certainly an opening...

A sex-ish dream? Ava is ... very strange? 

And a drive thru wedding. That's certainly a thing. 

And... that's what DJ stands for. 

## 8. *69 Million*

Whelp. 

> You can drop all your shit there, and don't fuck it up.  
> Words to live by.

A long way from the philosophy of randomness. But not entirely wrong either. 


> The entitled millennial is gonna have to drink 2%.
> 
> Emergency!
> 
> Somebody get an EpiPen!
> 
> [laughter]
> 
> Oh, God, that is rich.
> 
> Tell me, what exactly do people think millennials are entitled to?
> 
> Oh, God, here we go.
> 
> Huh?
> 
> Expensive-ass health care?
> 
> The planet ruined by ignoring climate change?
> 
> Yeah, the only thing millennials are entitled to is our future grandchildren running around the desert hellscape sucking shriveled dicks for water or whatever.
> 
> And also, most importantly, I'm Gen Z, okay?
> 
> There are millennials who are, like, 40.

lol. 

And an expensive lesson for someone. 

And Kathy. What did they say?!

## 9 *Interview*

Trouble with Ava and Deborah! 

Kind ... of self inflicted there. 

> Jimmy: What's going on?
> Marcus: Well, Deborah found out that Ava went to L.A. for that interview, and she's pissed.
> Jimmy: Hold on. I don't know what you're talking about. What interview?
> Marcus: Wait, you're asking me?

Uh oh. 

## 10. *I Think She Will*

> It's not from therapy. It's from mental health TikTok.  
> That's even worse. 

Well. 

Also.... Kayla is a lot. Which I suppose is the point. 

> Deborah Vance: ... I sign your paychecks.  
> Ava: Okay first of all... it's direct deposit. 

Oh Ava. 

> Ava: You are a fucking hack. 

And... roll credits. 

(Not yet! They have to make up!)

... oh. And then {{<spoiler>}}her dad{{</spoiler>}} died.
