Well. That was most certainly a thing.

When I first saw the trailors for WandaVision, it appeared to be a clip show taking Wanda and Vision through different eras of TV as a 'magical power couple'. Given that Vision was ... well, dead, I figured they would set the show during the years between Age of Ultron and Infinity War. 

Instead... we got something far, far weirder and creepier. 

**MINOR SPOILERS**

We do get the power couple through the ages, but from the very first episode there are hints that's something not quite right. As we go on, that feeling becomes stronger and stronger as things get creepier and creepier. It's a dark, terrifying look at dealing with the trauma that the MCU seems to inflict on it's characters and (with few exceptions) never really gets into. 

Plotwise, there are a few holes and problems with motivation, but it holds together just about as well (if not better) than anything else in the MCU. And we're getting a few answers that the movies just don't have time to deal with--I very much appreciate this middle ground between movies and the longer shows (such as Agents of SHIELD) that are less well tied to the main plotline. 

Characterwise, Elizabeth Olsen is amazing as Wanda, Paul Bettany continues to be an excellent AI learning to be human as the Vision, and their relationship continues to be just a little bit weird... There are almost 20 years between them (with Bettany that much older and Vision that much younger). Then again, finding a peer/partner is ... somewhat harder in their world. 

I also enjoyed seeing a number of characters from otherwise in the MCU pulled in. Teyonah Parris as Monica Rambeau (dealing with the Snap), Kat Dennins back as an out on her own Darcy Lewis, etc. 

Some might say that they wished for more (Mephisto, crossovers, other characters brother back or on the day), but I think what we got was already by far good enough. Every single MCU episode doesn't *have* to cross over and have Easter Eggs for every *little* **thing**. There were already enough. :)

Overall, a solid show and an excellent first outage for the Disney+ shorts between the movies. After 2020, it really makes me look forward to what promises to be an insane year for the MCU. 

Onward!

Side note: the Honest Trailors for WandaVision is awesome. Even more spoilers than what I had here, but if that doesn't bother you or if you've already watched the show, it's quick, great fun.
