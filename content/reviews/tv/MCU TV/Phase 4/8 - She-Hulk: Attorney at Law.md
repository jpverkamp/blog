> It's not easy being green. 

Well that's a strange one. She's the Hulk's cousin. One things lead to another, and she gets all Hulked out... but without any of the downsides? 

The contrast between being a Hulk and being a lawyer (and being a big green lawyer) is pretty cool, Tatiana Maslany does a wonderful job in the titular role, and it was great fun to see Tim Roth's Abomination again, not to mention Charlie Cox's Daredevil. Fun casting.

Plotwise, it's a really weird show. And they're rather solidly into the whoe 4th wall breaking thing, which is kind of amusing. Weird. But amusing. 

Overall, I enjoyed the show. Not my favorite of the MCU TV shows, but I'm glad to have watched it.

## Individual episode thoughts (spoilers)

## 1. *A Normal Amount of Rage*

Bit cheap that she doesnâ€™t really have to deal with the rage. Wonder if sheâ€™s the weird oneâ€¦ or Bruce was. 

Itâ€™s nice to see Ruffalo again. And Tatiana Maslany is great so far. I need to watch *Orphan Black*. 

## 2. *Superhuman Law*

She-Hulk. It is a dumb nameâ€”rather more 1980 comics. Funny that theyâ€™re hanging a lampshade on it in the modern world. 

I â€¦ did not expect Abomination. And the original actor no less. And â€¦ heâ€™s got a point. Fascinating. 

## 3. *The People vs Emil Blonsky*

Blonksky â€¦ is quite the character. 

The B-Plot of a terrible human being suing a fairly terrible shape shifting elf from New Asgard is â€¦ strange. But amusing. 

Also:

> Parole Officer #1: And as for Mr. Wong...

    Wong: Just "Wong." The Sorcerer Supreme. Master of the Mystic Arts. Leader and former librarian of Kamar-Taj.

    Parole Officer #1: Yeah. You realize that you've just admitted to facilitating a prisoner escape, which is a crime.

    Wong: I must depart.

    \[Wong stands up, creates a portal and leaves\] 

Wong is wonderful. 

## 4. *Is This Not Real Magic?*

Wong vs a stage magicianâ€¦ who happens to have a real magic doodad. 

Jen datesâ€¦ as She-Hulk. 

Madisynn, two Ns, one Y, ðŸŽµ but not where you think ðŸŽµ. 

What could possibly go wrong? 

## 5. *Mean, Green, and Poured Into These Jeans*

Legal proceedings on the name She-Hulkâ€¦ and a fashion designer for the super heroes. 

Oy. 

## 6. *Just Jen*

The wedding episode. :D

... kind of cute. 

Mr. Immortal, dying to get out of the conversations. Legally, not literally. 

... I do not get how that plot line works. Why are the lawyers working for the exes / widows?

## 7. *The Retreat*

Blonkski, spiritual advisor. I'm actually surprised at how wonderful that ended up being. 

The general plot of the show is... weird, but the little moments are great!

## 8. *Ribbit and Rip It*

Daredevil! And in a lawyer off no less. I like it. 

The Sekovia Accords have been repealed? Interesting. 

Also... Jen really missed Murdoch getting suits made? That's amusing. 

Delightful. Just delightful. 

## 9. *Whose Show is This?*

Oh that started delightfully weird... and then really went off the rails.

Truth be told, I'm not sure *what* to think of it. I like that they're trying to buck expectations... but they didn't end up with much of a finale. C'est la vide.
