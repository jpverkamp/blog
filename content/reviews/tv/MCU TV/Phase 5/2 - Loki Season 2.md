Another year, another Loki. I really enjoyed [[Loki|Season 1]](). No idea if they could top it. And I'm still not 100% sure if they made it better, but they most certainly made it weirder. And I'm here for it. 

The cast is great of course, with Tom Hiddleston's Loki carrying the show. I really did quite enjoy Jonathan Majors' new double role as He Who Remains but also now as Victor Timely. That's most certainly something--and makes me wonder if they can/could have actually pulled it all off, depending on if Majors sticks around in the MCU. 

As I mentioned in [the last episode review below](#6-glorious-purpose), it's a crazy show, and there's a lot to like about it. It could really change everything... but I have the unfortunate feeling they're not going to let it. We shall have to see!

## 1. *Ouroborus*

I feel like I may have wanted to watch S1... man this show is weird. 

OB is delightful! Oh Ke Huy Quan. Not perhaps the worst role to be typecast--the guy in time travel movies. 

## 2. *The Variant*

A new villain ish!

Loki doing the villain/hero arc again!

I really feel like I missed something in between, but it all made enough sense eventually. 

Also:

So... what about a million timelines worth of deaths? That's hard to even imagine, let alone care about. 

## 3. *1893*

The Chicago World fair and a whole pile of old (new?) faces. Oh time travel. Time loops. Meddling in time. 

New Variant Victor Timely? Not sure what to think about him. 

Ms. Minutes is such a delightfully odd character. 

Probably the least off the wall episode yet this season. 

## 4. *Heart of the TVA*

Timely is just in time? Him meeting OB and the two geeking out over each other was cute. 

> Loki: So, if your work is based on his work and his work is based on your work...
> Mobius: Exactly, which came first?
> OB: It's like a snake eating its own tail!

ðŸ˜ƒ

Also, the fairly extreme villain arc of Renslayer is a bit ... much? Feels weird. Ms. Minutes fits a bit better. 

Also also, characters dropping like flies 10 minutes before the end of an episode in a show built around time travel?

## 5. *Science/Fiction*

Everything exploded and Loki is unstuck in time once again. Oy. 

Now he has to round up the gang at least, all timey whimey style. It's kind of strange--isn't the entire point that there are many variants of each of them? That they're all variants? So why these specific versions? And why mostly all in and around California?

## 6. *Glorious Purpose*

And it all comes back to not only where it all ended, but also where it all began. 

It's a crazy show, and there's a lot to like about it. It could really change everything... but I have the unfortunate feeling they're not going to let it.
