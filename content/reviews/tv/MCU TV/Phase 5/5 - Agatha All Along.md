Oh that was a delight. Take Agatha (and the general fallout of her created world) from [[WandaVision]](), turn up the witchiness, and go on a magical mystical, somewhat terrifying adventure. 

It's a fascinating story and, honestly, if you would have left out a few scenes it would have worked perfectly well completely outside of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well. And at this point, that's a strong point in its favor. 

Man Kathryn Hawn does great in this. I loved the supporting witch cast, especially Aubrey Plaza. She does unsettling and off kilter so well. And Teen--he was an interesting counterpoint. I'm not sure about the worldbuilding around either Rio (Plaza) or Teen (Locke), those parts felt weird, but the actors were awesome. 

And of course... **the song** (I don't see this version as spoilers, but some might).

{{<youtube VnjYeJ5blxo>}}

Man that song has been stuck in my head for weeks now. 

I personally would have dropped the last half of the last episode, the penultimate really works better as a conclusion. This really doesn't need a sequel (although apparently there will be a third show as a 'TV trilogy' sort of thing?), but so it goes.

# Agatha All Along

## 1. *Seekest Thou The Road*

Agatha was ... a crime scene investigator all along?

> what no working professional crone

That is a very disconcerting episode. Like [[WandaVision]]() but even creepier. And I can only imagine how it was for her...

(And then naked)

## 2. *Circle Sewn With Fate / Unlock Thy Hidden Gate*

> Teen

Censored. Wonderful. 

It's amusing watching Agatha collect everyone that hates her. 

> Jennifer Kale: I haven't been convicted of anything.
> Agatha Harkness: Yet. Historically, we as a group don't do well in courtrooms.

Down down down the road, down the witches road

## 3. *Through Many Miles / Of Tricks and Trials*
> Was that there before?
> We should stop asking that question. 

And... Teen is supposed to be Agatha's son. But... I honestly couldn't tell you which way I expect more. 

## 4. *If I Can't Reach You / Let My Song Teach You*

> Teen: That was our fatal mistake. 
> Agatha: Most fatal for Mrs. Hart. 

Well. 

> Are we in trouble Agatha? Like. More than we were ten minutes ago. 

Well. 

Down down down the road. 

Aubrey Plaza does unhinged so well. 
## 5. *Darkest Hour / Wake Thy Power*

> The moral of the story kids. Always finish what you started. Also mercy is overrated. 

What *was* that ending. 

## 6. *Familiar By Thy Side*

A past meeting. And not at all between who I expected. 

> But I did find this guy on Reddit. 

And then it got so much weirder. 

That was a whole episode full of waaaaat. 

## 7. *Death's Hand in Mine*

The timey whimey one. 

Oh man that would be so confusing. 

Both for her and anyone around her. 

But like she said. So many pieces fitting together. 

More than one twist though. 

And Rio is...

...huh. 

## 8. *Follow me My Friend / Glory at the End*

> {{<spoiler>}}So Agatha's ex is Death. {{</spoiler>}}  
> {{<spoiler>}}That also makes sense. {{</spoiler>}}

All righty then. :smile:

> You nonstop sociopath. 

And then ... showdown. Sacrifice. 

And this isn't even the finale?!

...

...

oh. 

Oh. 

Ooooohhhh. 

## 9. *Maiden Mother Crone*


> I spoke no spell
> I cast no incantation 
> You... you were made from scratch. 

Flashback!

> Down down down the road. Down the witches road. 

They probably could have skipped that last half though.
