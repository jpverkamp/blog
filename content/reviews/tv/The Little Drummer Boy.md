That's cute. A fun art style that really fits these videos, it's something I watched each year when I was younger. Great to see once again. And it's not any more out of date than it was before then. 

It's interesting to realize that the song only came about in the 40s and this was only made into a movie in the 60s. Especially since that means that for such a well know 'Christmas' story, it's really got very little backend religiously. 

I still enjoy it. :smile: Worth a watch.
