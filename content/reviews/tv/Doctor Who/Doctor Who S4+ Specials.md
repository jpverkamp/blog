The 2008-2010 specials!

We have:

## The Next Doctor

Where the Doctor meets... the Doctor?!

> Jackson Lake: There she is. My transport through time and space. The TARDIS!  
> The Doctor: You've got a balloon.  
> Jackson Lake: TARDIS. T - A - R - D - I - S. It stands for Tethered Aerial Release Developed in Style! Do you see?  
> The Doctor: Well, I do now. I like it. Good TARDIS.  

And you know? Dervla Kirwan as Miss Hartigan gets a bit of flack, but if you ignore for a moment the history of the {{<spoiler>}}Cybermen{{</spoiler>}}, she's quite the fun row. Plus, an absolutely giant robot in old fashioned london down. What's not to love? 

## Planet of the Dead

The Doctor, sent through a portal to a desert planet, where he has to depend on a temporary companion in jewel thief Lady Christina to get back home. 

> Christina: It's Christina Da Souza. To be precise it's Lady Christina Da Souza.  
> The Doctor: Oh, that's handy because I'm a lord.  
> Christina: Seriously, lord of where?  
> The Doctor: It's quite a big estate.  

It's yet another case (Voyage of the Damned was another one) where a companion for a special would have been *fascinating* to keep around. So it goes though. 

## The Waters of Mars

Fixed points in time don't *really* make sense for the Doctor. Especially given how it turns out in the end. But still, a giant marsbase and soggy zombies? What's not to love? 

And it's yet another one of those episodes that digs just into how broken and--at some level--insane the Doctor is, after all those years and triumphs. And failures.

> Adelaide: But you said we die. For the future. For the human race!  
> The Doctor: Yes, because there are laws. There are laws of time. Once upon a time there were people in charge of those laws but they died. They all died. Do you know who that leaves? *Me!* It's taken me all these years to realize that the laws of time are *mine* and they will obey me!

Quite the set up for...

## The End of Time (Parts One and Two)

Tennats finale is coming...

> The Doctor: Even if I change it still feels like dying. Everything I am dies. Some new man goes sauntering away... and I'm dead.

But on the way, we have Wilfred Mott as the Doctor's companion? Yes please. 

> The Doctor: I'm going to die.  
> Wilfred Mott: Well, so am I one day.  
> The Doctor: Don't you dare!  
> Wilfred Mott: Alright, I'll try not to.  

And add to that, the Master (back from he dead) and perhaps... something even worse. 

Oh that's an intense pair of episodes. Even if it's more than a *touch* overdone at times (as all of ennats finales seem to be). 

But this time around, we get a victory lap of sorts. 

And so Ten ends. 

> The Doctor: I don't want to go.

On to Eleven!
