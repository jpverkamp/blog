Oh Doctor Who. 

This such a wonderful season (and I do say that about a lot of the seasons). 

First off, we have Donna back as the companion. I do love that she's not pining after the Doctor as others have been want to do. And she's just so delightfully snarkily--human. They really do play off each other well. 

On top of that, we have *The Fires of Pompeii*, with both a future Doctor and a future companion (in other rolls), *Planet of the Ood* (delightfully creepy), *The Doctor's Daughter* (actually his wife...), *Silence in the Library* (well, okay maybe she is), and *Midnight* (for such a limited set it's so intense). 

There are just so many solid episodes this season!

Onward, to the 2008-2010 specials! Man those can be a pain to find/categorize. I'm still not sure why they weren't just considered season 4.5 or even season 5. 

Onward!
