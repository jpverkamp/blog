We were in a frying sort of mood after [yesterday's pickle chips]({{< ref "2011-01-16-corn-breaded-pickle-chips.md" >}}), so today we decided to make some homemade tortilla chips.

It's actually a really simple process:

* cut up a tortilla
* fry the pieces

Who'da thunk?

I wish I'd gotten a few more pictures while we were still making them, but it turns out that they're too tasty. We were eating them faster than I could fry more. Really, we're lucky that we got even this shot.

If you ever have the time (and you don't need much) and spare tortillas, I really would suggest you try it. It's amazing to have chips and salsa, all homemade.
