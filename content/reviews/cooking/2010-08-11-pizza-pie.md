Don't tell me you've never considered it... Literally making a pizza *pie*? Putting pizza toppings in a pie shell?

Well not to worry! You don't have to wonder anymore!

We made it!

Basically, take whatever pizza filling you want (we went traditional with only tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and pepperoni) and put it in a pie shell. Bake and eat.

Unfortunately, it doesn't turn out *quite *so well in practice as you'd think in theory. The sweetness of the pie crust goes great with fruity filling, it's just weird with pizza fillings. Still--we had to do it. For science!
