Pumpkin pie, truly the reason for the season.

Other than the crust, everything is made from scratch! Including the whipped cream.

First, you cut up the pumpkins and scoop out the guts:

Next, you cook them for a while (see above). The nice bit is that once you've cooked them, the skin comes right off. That is glorious, since it's so much easier to peel than with a knife.

See, the skin just comes right off:

Next, mix everything except the spices into the pumpkin puree:

And now mix in the spices. The spices really make the pie:

Then... bake! It's odd that it's at two different temperatures, but so it goes:

And, we're done!
