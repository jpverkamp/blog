We made homemade ice cream! Based on a post on Disney's FamilyFun website, you need:

* sugar
* half and half
* vanilla
* salt
* ice cubes
* nested ziplock bags


<!--more-->

(You can get the exact ingredients on the website.)

To make it, all you have to do is combine everything but the salt and ice in the smaller bag, put the smaller bag into the larger with the salt and ice, and shake for about five minutes. Bam. Ice cream.

And look, it even looks like ice cream!
