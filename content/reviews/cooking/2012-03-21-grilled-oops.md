Some part of my always wondered what would happen to a grilled cheese if you left it on the Foreman Grill and forgot about it...

Oh right. That.

In case you were wondering, that's cheese in the top right. Completely solid cheese that feels more like plastic than anything. Luckily, it seems that the grill will shut off the heating unit if it's left on for too long, so this is all the worse it was, but still... At least now I know!
