Today we have one of those simple recipes when you're short on prep time but still want something delicious.

You'll need:

* chicken
* rice
* tomatoes
* herbs and spices (we used basil and oregano)
* olive oil


<!--more-->

Basically, go ahead and start the rice. While that's cooking, just put everything down in layers in something bake-with-able.

Stick it in the oven and about twenty minutes later... bam. Chicken and tomatoes:

It's amazing how easy it is to cook sometimes. :smile:
