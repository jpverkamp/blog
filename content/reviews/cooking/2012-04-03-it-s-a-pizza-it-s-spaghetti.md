... it's pizzaghetti!

<!--more-->

Start with some onions for the pizza-y bits.

Boil water and make some spaghetti (I'm not even sure what this would be without the spaghetti, just fried pizza? (Wait, that sounds amazing!))

There's really nothing like the smell of caramelizing onions.

For the pizza-y bits, we definitely need green peppers and pepperoni.

Make sure everything is nice and fried.

Now that we have pizza-y bits and spaghetti-y bits, why don't we see how they go together?

Mixed... and bam. Pizzaghetti. And they said that it couldn't be done.

Just because everything is better with cheese... (And you can't really have the pizza-y half without cheese!)
