Grilled cheese? Cheeseburger? You decide!

If you have a <a title="Amazon: Foreman Grill" href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;field-keywords=foreman%20grill">Foreman Grill</a>, you owe it to yourself to try this out:

* grill the burger in the Foreman Grill or in a skillet
* make a grilled cheese with at least two slices of American cheese
* peel apart the grilled cheese and insert the burger (and any condiments--I'm partial to spicy brown mustard)

Enjoy!
