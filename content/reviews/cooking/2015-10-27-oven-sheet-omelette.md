Cooked something worth blogging about, if only because it's so easy.

**Ingredients**

* Ground beef (cooked and seasoned)
* 3 small potatoes
* A dozen eggs
* An onion
* Cheese


**Recipe**

* Preheat oven to 425â„‰
* Slice the potatoes thinly (I used a food processor)
* Pre-cook the potatoes for 5 minutes in the microwave
* Spray a deep oven sheet
* Put down a layer of potatoes and onions, then the beef
* Pour eggs over the whole thing
* Bake for 10 minutes
* Slice and server


In progress, we have everything ready to go in the oven:

(Keen-eyed observers will note I may have forgotten the onions...)

And done / partially eaten:

It's really easy with only a couple minutes of prep and 15 minutes of waiting time. Nice for when you have only limited supplies and want a breakfasty dish.
