> Munchkinland Kid: But, Miss Glinda?  
> Glinda: Yes?  
> Munchkinland Kid: Why does wickedness happen?  
> Glinda: That's a good question, one many people find confusifying. Are people born wicked? Or do they have wickedness thrust upon them? After all, The Wicked Witch had a childhood. She had a father, who, by the way, had been appointed governor of Munchkinland. And she had a mother, as so many do.  

The story of the Wicked Witch of the West (who wasn't always so Wicked), her time at university (which, for some reason, is called Shiz), and her unlikely friendship with Galinda (before she was Glinda). 

It's basically the Broadway play writ silver screen and you know, it actually works pretty well. There is room for a lot of visuals you can't *really* pull off on a stage, along with some face work and camera shots likewise. 

Storywise, it's a fairly classic (at this point), 'what if the villan wasn't evil, how did they get here?' sort of story. 

> Fiyero: I'll say this much, she doesn't give a twig what anyone thinks.
> Glinda: Of course she does. She just pretends not to.

Mix all that with a sassy Elphaba (who's supposed to be the Wicked one) and a somewhat clueless entirely self centered Glinda (who's supposed to be the Good one)...

> Elphaba: Fine, let's get this over with: no, I am not seasick; no, I did not eat grass as a child; and yes, I've always been green.  
> Glinda: Well, I, for one, am... So sorry, that you have been forced to live with... this.  
> Elphaba: Is that so?  
> Glinda: Yes! And it is my intention to major in sorcery. So, if at some point, you wanted to address the, um... Problem...  
> Elphaba: Problem.  
> Glinda: ... perhaps I could help.  
> [the whole Shiz students clap and praise her, while Elphaba analyzes the reaction]  
> Elphaba: Offering to help someone that you don't know with skills that you don't have, I'm sure everyone is duly impressed.  
> Glinda: I could care less what others think.  
> Elphaba: Couldn't.  
> Glinda: What?  
> Elphaba: You couldn't care less what other people think. Though, I... I doubt that.  

I wouldn't really expect anything new and interesting, but it's solidly done. And hey, some great songs!

And best of all? By finally watching it now, part 2 is already out. Onward!
