Fun idea at least and although it had some problems in execution, I enjoyed it well enough. The action scenes were neat, particularly the flaming ax-fu of firey doom (which they could have used more of).

The idea that slavery was just a way for the vampires to easily feed seemed a bit rough and seems to be trying to push off a rather important part of our history as a predatory thing rather than being racist which felts weird, but at least the didn't dwell on that too overly much.

It does make me wonder what other sorts of history figures they could do the same though. Sort of the same idea as *Pride and Prejudice and Zombies*, only with historical figures.

Overall, I'll put it about in the middle. It falls right with (and slightly above) that other vampire movie, so that's something at least.
