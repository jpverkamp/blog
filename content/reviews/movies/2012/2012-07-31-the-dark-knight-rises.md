This is another movie right up there with the Avengers in terms of anticipation and I have to say that it delivered. There's just something about super hero movies that's going particularly well right now. I'm not sure how long this is going to last, but I'm more than happy to ride it while it does.

Of the Dark Knight trilogy, I think this was actually my favorite. Bane felt like a better villian than the Joker, the Scarecrow, or Ra's al Ghul. I'm glad that they backed off on the overdone audio processing (I've seen a few of the clips on YouTube) and even then it was still a bit much to understand at times, but I think that helped with his feeling of "otherness".

On the downside, it was long. Probably too long. People are looking for an even longer director's cut, which seems a bit strange to me. From my point of view, it could easily have been a half hour shorter. Not my call though.

Still, a solid summer blockbuster all around. It's more my sort of movie than Brave, so it will take the number three spot for the year.

(Also, why is Batman always "The Batman"? What's with the definite article? It's the same thing with {{< wikipedia page="Lambda calculus" text="the lambda calculus" >}} and I've never really figured it out either way.)
