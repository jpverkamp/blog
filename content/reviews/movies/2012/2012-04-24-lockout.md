Lockout was a pretty good action movie--in space! I don't really mind movies like that, where they take a premise that has been done before and just change the setting. Although in general, I'd like for the science of the movie to be a bit more sensical. And the whole premise of just sending up one man to save the president's daughter seems a bit off. Sure, the prisoners might kill her off if they send more, but isn't the entire point that they don't at first realize who they have? So it goes.

Still, so far as a fun science fiction / action movie goes, it was pretty good. I liked it enough to put this all of the way up at number two for the year, so I guess that's saying something. Just don't go in expecting anything particularly deep or accurate in the scientific sense.
