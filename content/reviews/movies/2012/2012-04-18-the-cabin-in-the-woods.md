I generally don't go for horror movies, but the general premise intrigued me. And it doesn't hurt that Joss Whedon co-wrote it. He's had his ups and downs, but in general he's earned at least a second look in my book.

First thought? Worth it. Well worth it. It started as as a straight forward slash flick, but once you started to get into a bit more of the background, it was just a really interesting idea. I liked seeing the feel of people doing something that they have to know is wrong, but doing it for a good reason. A solid example of the ends justifying the means.

And then there's the ending. For some reason that just feels so satisfying. I won't go into any detail (*spoilers*), but suffice it to say that if they ever made a sequel, I'd be rather impressed--although I would love to see what they could do with it.

This comes in at the top of my list for now and I have a feeling that it's going to stay there for a while. If you're a fan of horror at all or even just not really bothered by a little (well, a lot at times) of blood and gore, go see this movie.

Perhaps if Joss Whedon can pull off the The Avengers to the extent that everyone is hoping it might top this. Maybe something else will surprise me. We'll see. Still, for now, this is the new #1.
