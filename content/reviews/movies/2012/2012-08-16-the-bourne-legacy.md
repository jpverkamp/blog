So what do you get if you make a Bourne movie and take out Bourne?

Well... I'm still not sure. I think that if it hadn't had the Bourne name it would actually have been a pretty decent film. And at least it gave Jeremy Renner a bit more of a chance to shine than The Avengers did and he did well enough.

Still, the other Bourne movies were better. It's kind of interesting how far this feels from the other Bourne movies. It's just about as far as any of the movies are from the books of the same name. So it goes, I guess.

Overall, I wanted to like it. It just wasn't in the cards. Down near the bottom for this one.
