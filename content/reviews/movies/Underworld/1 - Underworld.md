Modern Day. Vampires versus Werewolves. That's basically Underworld in a nutshell.

Luckily, it does it very well. 

<!--more-->

In short, Underworld follows a world where Vampires and Werewolves exist and have been trying to kill each other (in secret) for a very, very long time. Plotwise, it's not complicated. Some Vampires and Werewolves are trying to kill each other, others are trying to figure out new ways to end the war once and for all. There's politics and betrayal galore and no one is really on your side. Or at least not only on your side. 

Visualwise, it's so very washed over color, almost entirely black and white with a cold blue overtone. And it's all so dark and dreary. But... Vmapires. It fits. Between that and the music, it really feels a lot like the Matrix at times. But it works. 

Castingwise, Kate Beckinsale as Selene does Hot Vampire Warrior Woman well, Scott Speedman as Michael does straightman Human thrown into this mess well enough, and Sophia Myles as Erika nails Vampiric 'Hell Hath No Fury'. But the really spectacular part of the movie is the big name vampire and werewolve: Bill Nighy as (Elder Vampire) Viktor and Michael Sheen as (Werewolf Leader) Lucian. Man the two of them act the heck out of the roles. I love Bill Nighy's monster rolls (see {{<crosslink text="The Pirates of the Caribbean" title="Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest">}})) and Sheen contrast it well. 

I think the only casting/character I don't care for is Shane Brolly as (vampire) Kraven. He's... mostly just winey and unlikeble, but I don't really even understand where he's really going with the roll. 

It's not great art or a spectacular movie, but it is one that I'll come back to every few years. It's got a great dark/gothic feel to it and it's just fun to watch. Midling on my movies for the year, but still worth the rewatch! On to the sequels.
