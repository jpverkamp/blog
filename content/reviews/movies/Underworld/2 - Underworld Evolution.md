Quite an interesting contrast compared to the first {{<crosslink "Underworld">}}. Where the first was a straight forward vampire/werewolf urban fantasy action flick, Evolution tries to be more. We get deeper worldbuilding, more backstory--especially for Selene--and more hints that the entire world is changing. It works... well enough? 

<!--more-->

Things that I liked: 

* Selene and Michael's growing relationship--we get a lot more of the two of them
* Michael coming into his new role, whatever that ends up being
* More backstory and worldbuilding, from the time of the original vampire/werewolves
* Marcus as the remaining big bad Vampire Elder--I'd forgotten he was in this when I saw him as Vincent van Gogh in Doctor Who--that's... quite a different role, but he does a crazy sort of terrifying really well
* {{<spoiler>}}The hidden power older than either line: the father of both{{</spoiler>}}--this was particularly cool
* Fighting around a downed helicopter set piece--you know how it's going to end, but I still loved it
* Steven Mackintosh's Tanis. Mercenary bookie vamp. Works out pretty well. He looks really familiar... but I'm not sure what from. I think perhaps he looks vaguely like Stephen Moyer from True Blood? 

Things that aren't as great:

* Nighy's Viktor is barely in a few flashbacks and Sheen's Lucian isn't really in the film at all; understandable given the events of the first, but they really *made* that film
* I feel like they changed a number of things that would have come up in the first film--Selene's backstory and the new hidden power in particular; making it up as they went along

Things that are kind of weird:

* A *lot* more nudity than the first film--it's got the R-rating, but it feels... strange to have in this one but not the first

Overall, a solid sequel (that really wouldn't stand alone). A bit lower down the list, but I'll almost surely rewatch it whenever I rewatch the first one, they complement each other well.
