It's been a while. Both since watching {{crosslink "Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"}} and in universe. 

I really like the idea of advancing the world. Bringing the Vampires and the Lycans out into the open. And the humans *winning* as, with their numbers, makes enough sense in this universe. 

> Selene: For 12 years, I was held captive by the humans. The world I once knew has changed. Vampires and Lycans are now the hunted.

The plot is... fine? It's jarring shifting focus away from Michael--I wonder if there was a dispute over money there--but the new family is an interesting idea. The human/Vampire rivalry is cool; especially when it turns out {{<spoiler>}}they were secret Lycans all along{{</spoiler>}}. The Vampires just wanting to hide and live their lives is an interesting twist. 

Productionwise, man the Lycans in particular look *cheap*. Especially with double the budget of any of the other films thus far. And there's just so much gore. It's a hallmark of the films, but... it was a lot. 

Overall, it's fine. An interesting idea but middling execution. I'm glad they took a chance on it. And I'm curious enough to see where they go next!

Random aside: 

> Lane's Assistant: [Selene is holding Lane's Assistant out of a window] Please! I'm the one who let you go!  
> Selene: Consider us even.  
> [Drops Lane's assistant out of the window]  

... it's so dumb, but hilarious. 

Also, I hope his name was Michael. 

Mic drop. 

Get it?
