Oh hey, that's a DeLorean! I should go re-watch Back to the Future. 

Ready Player One is a very pretty movie (I seem to be saying that [a lot]{{<ref "Alita: Battle Angle">}}) recently) and absolutely chock full of pop culture references... which honestly felt rather overdone. The plot is thin and the world doesn't *really* make sense, although I did enjoy the characters well enough.

<!--more-->

The whole idea of a near future dystopia based around people spending more of their lives virtually than in real life isn't really a new one, but it's still something worth exploring--which I think Ready Player One does decently, if not spectacularly. 

It's weird how everything seems to be based on a single avatar per player, with persistent gear that you have to pay for and could easily lose--except I suppose that's *exactly* how I can imagine companies building a game out like this. Gotta make money and all that. 

Nostalgiawise, it's fun enough. I don't really get it, but there were a whole handful of 'oh hey I know that thing' moments. It's a little weird that a world 30 years in our future seems to be mostly referencing things from 30 years ago. I suppose the Oasis was belt in our very near future? 

Plotwise, it's a fetchquest and learning a bit about themselves as you go along. I suppose. The whole idea that absolutely no one ever decided to just... {{<spoiler>}}drive backwards{{</spoiler>}} is kind of hard to believe. I remember doing that in racing games *decades* ago. And in the end, everyone stood up and clapped--said no one ever. 

Characterwise, the mains were fine but nothing particularly special. Tye Sheridan as Parzival was mostly awkward and weird, but I suppose that's entirely the point. Olivia Cooke as Art3mis was much better.And I really did love the big corp villainous sort: Ben Mendelsohn as Sorrento. 

Overall, I was hoping for more. It was a fun enough movie though and I'm glad I finally watched it. 

Onward!
