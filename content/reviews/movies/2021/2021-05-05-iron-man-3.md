For some reason, I Iron Man 3 as a fairly week entry, but [looking back to when I last watched it in theaters]({{< ref "2013-05-06-iron-man-3" >}})... I actually liked it about as much then I do now.

On one hand, I really do still think they absolutely nailed Robert Downey Jr. as Iron man. He can do both funny and broken pretty well and has more than a few chances for each this time around. I know now (and didn't then) that there wouldn't be an Iron Man 4, but he still did an amazing job in this last solo outing and in the teams ups yet to come. 

Otherwise, I actually really liked Gwyneth Paltrow's as Pepper Potts. It's good seeing her as both a foil for Iron Man and actually being a badass in her own right. 

Ben Kingsley still steal the show, although this time around I'm coming to see just how much range there was in Guy Pearce's Aldrich Killian. He pulled down on his luck geek up through brilliant and crazy mirror to Tony Stark all the way to {{< spoiler >}}fire breathing baddie{{< /spoiler >}} pretty darn well so far as action movies go.

One that I didn't mention last time around, but made all the more apparent I think having just seen in her in [Godzilla vs Kong]({{ ref "Godzilla vs Kong" }}) was Rebecca Hall's performance as Maya Hansen. She does smart conflicted scientist very well in both films. 

Plotwise, it was a fascinating way to deal with PTSD, even if does feel a bit sudden (although PTSD can do that) and could really have used a bit deeper dive (not really room for that in a summer blockbuster). 

Other than that, feel free to give my [previous review]({{< ref "2013-05-06-iron-man-3" >}}) a look. I haven't really changed my opinion much, but it's interesting to see the two 8 years apart. A lot can change in 8 years... Both so far as the MCU and in my own life. Some things change, some things stand the tests of time. 

I think this time around, I'll slot it in just below the Avengers on both lists. I think Iron Man 3 might actually be the better movie in a lot of ways, but the Avengers I think wins just on sheer spectacle. Feel free to disagree. :) It's all made up numbers anyways.
