You know, I was actually pleasantly surprised by Bambi II (later retitled). And not only because they got Patrick Stewart of all people to voice Bambi's dad (who now has to step up and be a single father). It's as cute a story as Bambi was--which the kids' appreciated--but with just a bit more depth--which I did. It's still certainly not high cinema, but it's not terrible either. 

Onward!

Fun facts (from IMDb):

> This movie broke the record of the longest interval between a prequel/midquel/sequel and its predecessor, previously held by The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Return to Oz (1985). Bambi (1942) was released in 1942, Bambi and the Great Prince of the Forest (2006) in 2006, sixty-four years later. 

Likewise:

> Sir Patrick Stewart (The Great Prince) is the only actor to appear in this movie who was alive at the time that Bambi (1942) was produced. 

Following up:

>  The Great Prince of the Forest is the first character that Sir Patrick Stewart finally voiced after previously turning down the roles of several characters, including King Triton in The Little Mermaid (1989), Cogsworth in Beauty and the Beast (1991), Jafar in Aladdin (1992), Zazu in The Lion King (1994), Governor Ratcliffe in Pocahontas (1995), and Zeus in Hercules (1997). 

Can you imagine... any of those? Although they did get Ian McKellen as Cogsworth in the live action Beauty and the Beast. Oh, what could have been.
