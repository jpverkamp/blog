Finding Nemo is a delightful children's movie. It's the story of a worrying dad (Marlin), a son (Nemo) trying to grow into his own self, the trouble that causes, and the lengths family can go through for one another. 

<!--more-->

A few particularly delightful things: 

- The entire Dory storyline. She's a fish with no short term memory and she teams up with Marlin to help rescue Nemo. Voiced by Ellen DeGeneres, who does a surprisingly good job. 

    > Dory: I shall call him Squishy and he shall be mine and he shall be my Squishy. Come on, Squishy. Come on, little Squishy.
    > 
    > [baby talk, the jellyfish stings her]
    > 
    > Dory: Ow. Bad Squishy, bad Squishy.

    It's just a cute role and an excellent counter to the overly worrysome Marlin. 

- The entire storyline with the surfer dude Turtles in the East Australian Current. It's a little silly and overdone, but for a kids' movie it works. And again, it serves to show Marlin another style of parenting and that it's okay not to worry so much. 

    > Crush: Okay. Squirt here will now give you a rundown of proper exiting technique.
    > 
    > Squirt: Good afternoon. We're gonna have a great jump today. Okay, first crank a hard cutback as you hit the wall. There's a screaming bottom curve, so watch out. Remember: rip it, roll it, and punch it.
    > 
    > Marlin: It's like he's trying to speak to me, I know it.

- The 'found family' storyline in the dentist's tank. That's a wonderfully weird bunch of fish and I enjoy the brotherhood / jailbrake scenes immensely.

    > Gill: From this moment on, you shall now be known as Sharkbait.
    > 
    > Bloat, Gurgle, Bubbles: Sharkbait! Hoo ha ha!
    > 
    > Gill: Welcome, Brother Sharkbait!
    > 
    > Bloat, Gurgle, Bubbles: Sharkbait! Hoo ha ha!
    > 
    > Gill: Enough with the Sharkbait.
    > 
    > Gurgle: Sharkbait! Hoo... bop pa doo.

    Especially with the whole mentor that also has an imperfect fin. It's okay to be different!

So... basically the entire movie. :)

It's a lot of good fun. Easily the best Pixar movie I've reviewed thus far :smile:--although I do expect it can remain up there!

Wow. Finding Nemo first came out nearly 20 years ago... I feel old.
