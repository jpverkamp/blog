From [one of the weakest]({{< ref "2021-05-12-thor-the-dark-world" >}}) MCU movies to one of the strongest. I loved the first solo entry of Captain American and the second is even better. Much like [last time]({{< ref "2014-04-05-captain-america-the-winter-soldier" >}}), I very much enjoyed this movie. 

It's a solid contrast against the first Captain America (blind optimistic patriotism versus a darker world, where even your friends... might not be). It's made all the better having already seen the future of Sam and Bucky/The Winter Soldier now. Last time through, I was hoping they could pull off all the new characters and now... I think they did. 

This time around (and so far), the top of my list for the year. An excellent movie.
