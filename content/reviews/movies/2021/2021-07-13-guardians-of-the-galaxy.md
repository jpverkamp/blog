I had forgotten just how *fun* Guardians of the Galaxy is. Back when I [first reviewed it in 2014]({{< ref "2014-08-05-guardians-of-the-galaxy" >}}), it surprised me with how different it was and just how much it opened up the Marvel Universe. Well, we've seen some pretty crazy things since then (Thor Ragnarok springs to mind), but it's still a pretty crazy movie. I mean, come on. It's a man obsessed with classic rock, a badass green woman assassin, an overly literal shirtless wrestler, a cybernetically enhanced racoon, and a speaking tree [^iamgroot] [^wearegroot]. Add in the first real hints of the Infinity Stones, Thanos as the continuing 'bigger bad', and you have a pretty impactful movie. 

And then on top of that, you get an absolutely hilarious movie, some wonderful action scenes (the meet up / fight in the square at the beginning is particularly wonderful, but there are several), and a whole range of colorful new characters. When you don't have to even try to stick to what works on Earth... things get pretty silly. 

Overall, a wonderful movie. I think this time around, I actually rate it higher than the Avengers, although still below Iron Man and Captain America 1 and 2. Well worth a watch. 

For the record: the ending scene is still kind of dumb. 

Random side note: the idea of a whole fleet of starships linking up (somehow) and literally trying to push a very slow moving enemy spaceship back into space is just bonkers. Among a movie full of crazy scenes, that one came the closest to really pulling me out of the film. But so it goes.
