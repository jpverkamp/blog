Way back in 2008, I don't think anyone had the slightest idea how far the Marvel Cinematic Universe would go. Taking a less well known superhero (face it, before this few knew who Iron Man was), attaching him to a talented but troubled actor (Robert Downy Jr was an amazing cast) and make a fairly stock standard action movie and... build a media empire that would span more than 12 years and 20 films (so far...).

Crazy. 

And going back to how it all started out? Well, you can see why they got a chance to do what they did. Iron Man is a **solid** summer blockbuster and a great way to do an origin story (especially one that hasn't been told to death). 

<blockquote>Obadiah Stane: [shouting] Tony Stark was able to build this in a cave! With a box of scraps! </blockquote>

The rise of a hero. Pretty standard plot. 

Characterwise, Robert Downy Jr. is pretty much the perfect genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist[^avengers]. His tech is cool (suspenion of disbelief required[^computers]). He tries to do the right thing. 

Gwyneth Paltrow is actually really good as the slightly awkward but super efficient personal assistant Pepper Potts. She especially has the look for it. 

And then there's Jeff Bridges... oh he makes a good villian. It's a bit distracting hearing The Dude creep in, but if anyone was to come back for another turn as the baddie, he'd be a good one. 

Overall, quite the solid story. And oh that ending. *kiss*

<blockquote>
Tony Stark: There's been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop...

Christine Everheart: I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared, despite the fact that...

Tony Stark: I know that it's confusing. It is one thing to question the official story, and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I'm a superhero.

Christine Everheart: I never said you were a superhero.

Tony Stark: Didn't?

Christine Everheart: Mmm-mmm.

Tony Stark: Well, good, because that would be outlandish and, uh, fantastic. I'm just not the hero type. Clearly. With this laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I've made, largely public.

Rhodey: [whispers to Tony] Just stick to the cards, man.

Tony Stark: Yeah, okay.

[holds up his notes and pauses]

Tony Stark: The truth is...

[puts cards down]

Tony Stark: I am Iron Man.

I'm going to be ranking the MCU movies as we go (much as I once did for movie reviews). Let's see how it goes!

{{< ranking "Marvel Cinematic Universe" >}}

{{< ranking "2021 Movie Reviews" >}}

[^avengers]: Yes, that's from a future movie. But it just fits pretty well. 

[^computers]: From a computer science perspective, I knew that the hardware was impressive, but the software is basically impossible **now**, let alone a decade ago... It's fun, but absolutely crazy what he has, with the holographic monitors up to and through Jarvis.
