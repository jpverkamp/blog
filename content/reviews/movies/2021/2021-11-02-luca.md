Luca is something of an odd beast. It's a cute little movie about two young sea monster boys who journey out onto land--where so long as they don't get wet, they transform to look like humans. Wacky hijinks ensue, there's a meetcute with a young girl, a big race scenes, some quickly resolved drama, and everyone lives happily ever after.

It's not the most thrilling movie, which isn't really something that you expect to see from Pixar--if it had come from any other studio it would have been pretty impressive. But at the same time, it's a solid enough movie, it's cute, and there were a few laugh out loud moments, so I'm glad to have seen it. I fully expect the children will enjoy this one--although it's rather odd watching it a week after Finding Nemo--a much better movie made 20 years earlier. 

Random thought of the day: shouldn't they transform when they cry?
