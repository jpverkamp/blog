Wow. 

That's one heck of a climax. 

In {{< crosslink "Avengers: Infinity War" >}}, Thanos won. He snapped and half of the universe died--let's ignore the logistics of that. In Endgame, there's a chance--a very small chance--that they can fix it all. All they need is a little --

Time Heist.

It's a ridiculous solution to an even more ridiculous problem, set up over a decade and two dozen films with the most big name stars and huge CGI battle scenes I've ever seen in a movie. And ... it just works. It's a wonderful spectacle that probably couldn't stand alone. But it doesn't have to. It can stand on the shoulders of Titans (heh) and absolutely nail the landing. 

I think the absolute crowning moment is the big final battle. A lot of of it doesn't make that much sense, but it doesn't have to. It's the payoff. Everyone[^widow] is back for one last big battle. And it is spectacular. 

Overall, if you've made it this far in the MCU, you're going to watch this movie. And I doubt you'll be disappointed. Some put Infinity War higher, some even put a few of the other individual movies higher, but so far as I'm concerned: this is what made it all worth it. 

Now the only question left is... what in the world can they possible do next?

[^widow]: Man they did a number on Scarlett Johansson, even here.
