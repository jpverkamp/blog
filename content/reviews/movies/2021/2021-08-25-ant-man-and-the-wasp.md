Ant-Man and his daughter are adorable. Especially with Luis' help. Luis is wonderful. Everyone playing Luis as he describes everyone. And Paul Rudd playing Janet van Dyne.  Add to that the interactions with/introduction of Jimmy Woo.

That's where the magic trick that comes up in WandaVision came from! I knew I'd seen that before. 

On another note, I love the scenes where big things are little. Driving in a mini car, with pigeons on the way. Windshield wipers. And little things are big, like ants helping in the workshop. It's sort of Ant-Man's jam... and it works. 

It's great seeing Evangeline Lilly as Hope Van Dyne/The Wasp. Even if she has boob plate. Although the real star is Hannah John-Kamen as Ava/Ghost. She's pretty cool. I wish they'd done more with her. 

It was also nice to see Laurence Fishburne as Dr. Bill Foster. He's been in a few things since the Matrix, but nothing I've seen. 

I think the only reason this movie ends up end of the pack is how good the MCU movies have gotten so far. It's still hilarious, full of action, and pushes together the greater MCU metaplot in interesting ways. Onward!
