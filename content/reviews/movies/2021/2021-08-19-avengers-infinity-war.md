All that. Ten years. 18 movies. Dozens of huge name actors and crossovers, all leading to this. {{< crosslink "The Avengers" >}} gave us a team up, but Infinity War turned it all up to 11. The battle scenes are insane (especially that final battle in Wakanda, especially especially the return of Thor), the villain--Josh Brolin as Thanos--is powerful and {{< spoiler >}}ACTUALLY GETS A CHANCE TO WIN{{</ spoiler >}}, and I absolutely love seeing the interplay between all of the characters.

In my opinion, the interplay between the characters is far better than in either {{< crosslink "The Avengers" >}} or {{< crosslink "Age of Ultron" >}}. The senses of humor felt natural to each. My particular favorites were seeing Iron Man and Doctor Strange ("Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards") and Thor meeting Quill and the Guardians.

But really, the best part of the movie is seeing the heroes outmatched, for what really feels like the first time. Seeing it in real time (before Endgame was out) was amazing and it holds up even now. Watching Thanos hold his own against Iron Man, Spider Man, Doctor Strange, and the Guardians at the beginning--taking all that for just a scratch is awesome. Kicking buts and cubing Drax/spiralizing Mantis was spectacular, and the final fight in Wakanda was a CGI fight for the ages. 

As I mentioned, Thor's return... *le kiss*

Easily among the best super hero/summer blockbusters of all time, even if / especially because of the decade of work that went into it. 

I can't wait to rewatch Endgame.
