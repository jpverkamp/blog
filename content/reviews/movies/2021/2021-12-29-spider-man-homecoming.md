*That* is a truly delightful Spider-Man movie. It's a bit weird seeing him introduced *after* the events of [Captain America: Civil War]({{< ref "2021-08-03-captain-america-civil-war" >}}) and completely skipping how he became Spider-Man in the first place... but it works. I really like the entire plot, dealing with the fallout of the Avengers / super-hero activity and how normal people try to live their lives around it--and what happens when the powers that be step in and take that away from them. Excellent villain fuel. It's a little silly that {{< spoiler >}}the Vulture ends up being Spider-Man's crush's father...{{</ spoiler >}}, but I suppose that's the sort of thing you expect from superhero films. Plotwise, it's a solid, fun action film. 

Castingwise, Tom Holland is great as Spider-Man. He actually feels like a dorky high schooler in a way Tobey Maguire never did and Andrew Garfield only sort of hit. He's way in over his head--but he doesn't care. He wants to do the right thing and he's already got the 'great power' thing down pat.

> Peter Parker: Yeah. A kid who can stop a bus with his bare hands.

Speaking of, Jacob Batalon as Ned is a great friend/confidant. He's even *more* geeky about the whole thing than Tom Holland is and the two feed off each other wonderfully. 

And then there's Zendaya as Michelle. She's got a wonderfully dry, weird sense of ... life. She doesn't have a huge amount to do in this film, but you can already see where they're going to go with her (and I have the benefit of having seen her do it Far From Home as well). Plus, I can totally see a number of people I went to school in her. 

> Peter Parker: I can't make it to the Decathlon next week. I have the Stark Internship.

> Abe: Oh, no.

> Michelle: Peter's not going to Nationals.
> 
> Abe: Why not?
> 
> Liz: Really, before Nationals?
> 
> Michelle: Figures. He's already bailed out on marching band and robotics club.

> Michelle: I'm not obsessed with him, I'm just super observant.

And of course... Marisa Tomei as May Parker. That... is kind of weird. It's a very different character from Rosemary Harris' version, but I think it works. 

And of course there's the relationship between Holland and Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man. It's not an Uncle Ben, but as a mentor/father figure, I really like how they're doing something different and it really does work pretty well. It ends up mostly a Spider-Man movie, a touch of an Iron Man/passing the torch movie, and it really works. 

> Tony Stark: Previously on "Peter Screws the Pooch", I tell you to stay away from this. Instead, you hacked a multi-million dollar suit so you could sneak around behind my back doing the *one thing* I told you not to do.
> 
> Peter Parker: Is everyone okay?
> 
> Tony Stark: No thanks to you.
> 
> Peter Parker: No thanks to me? Those weapons were out there and I tried to tell you about it, but you didn't listen. None of this would've happened if you had just listened to me! If you even cared, you'd actually be here.
> 
> [Tony Stark steps out of the suit to reveal that he *is* in fact there]
> 
> Tony Stark: I did listen, kid. Who do you think called the FBI, huh? Do you know that I was the only one who believed in you? Everyone else said I was *crazy* to recruit a 14-year-old kid.
> 
> Peter Parker: I'm 15.
> 
> Tony Stark: No, this is where you ZIP IT, alright? The adult is talking! What if somebody had died tonight? Different story, right? 'Cause that's on *you*. And if you died, I feel like that's on me. I don't need that on my conscience.
> 
> Peter Parker: Yes, sir, I...
> 
> Tony Stark: Yes.
> 
> Peter Parker: I'm sorry. In sorry.
> 
> Tony Stark: "Sorry" doesn't cut it.
> 
> Peter Parker: I understand. I just wanted to be like you.
> 
> Tony Stark: And I wanted you to be better. Okay, it's not working out. I'm gonna need the suit back.
> 
> Peter Parker: For how long?
> 
> Tony Stark: Forever.
> 
> Peter Parker: [on the verge of tears] No! No, no, no! Please, please, please!
> 
> Tony Stark: Let's have it.
> 
> Peter Parker: You don't understand! This is all I have! I'm nothing without this suit!
> 
> Tony Stark: If you're nothing without this suit, then you shouldn't have it, okay? God, I sound like my dad.
> 
> Peter Parker: I don't have any other clothes.
> 
> Tony Stark: Okay, we'll sort that out.

Overall, I loved it. It's just a *fun* film. Way up in my top of movies both this year and in the (extended) MCU. I just wish it were a little easier to watch.
