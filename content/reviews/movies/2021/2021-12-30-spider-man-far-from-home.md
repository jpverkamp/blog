As much as I loved {{< crosslink "Spider-Man: Homecoming" >}}, Spider-Man: Far From Home takes what made it great and turns it up a few levels *even further*.

One one level, you have Spider-Man being Spider-Man. He's a good kid, trying to make his way in life, trying to deal with the dual life of being a highschooler and being a superhero--of saving the world and perhaps getting the girl.

And then you layer all the weight of the greater MCU on top of it. This takes place just after {{< crosslink "Avengers: Endgame" >}}. So you have the fallout of Iron Man (Spider-Man's mentor/Uncle Ben figure) being gone and Spider-Man having to step into *those* shoes, the first big mention of The Blip--and how you deal with coming back and the world has changed, and all sorts of dealing with a Nick Fury who's lost several of his heaviest hitters.

And if *that* wasn't enough, you have the first hints of a multiverse ({{< spoiler >}}even if *this time* it was all a lie{{< /spoiler >}}). Jake Gyllenhaal as Quentin Beck / Mysterio is a great addition to the series and the MCU. I so want to see more of him. We'll just have to see. 

Other things I loved:

* Spider-Man having to balance a post-Endgame world with trying to be more local (now that he knows the costs...)

    > Peter Parker: [to journalists] Does anyone have any neighborhood questions? 

* Ned and Betty's Eurotrip relationship was *adorable*. They played it up in a way that wouldn't work in a movie more focussed around it, but it was great this time around. And gave MJ some room to grow. 

* Speaking of which, MJ! She's delightful and quirky and gets a lot more to do this time around, which is great. I sorely hope she sticks around...

* Getting more Nick Fury*. He's great.

    > Nick Fury: Off-world.

    > Peter Parker: I'm just your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.

    > Nick Fury: Bitch, please! You've been to space.

* Awesome battle scenes. In particular, Spider-Man fighting against an entire world of illusions was amazing. It's... a little hard to believe it could all be prepared ahead of time, but just let it go and it works!

Overall, even *better* than the first. I'm really looking forward to what in the world they can do in No Way Home...
