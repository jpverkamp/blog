It's a bit of bummer that The Incredible Hulk is stuck in sort of a legal loophole and isn't available with all the rest of the MCU on Disney+ (A̸̜̓L̶̬̽L̷̗̋ ̵̦̂Ĥ̴̖A̵͓͋I̴̝̓L̵̺̓ ̶͖̄T̶̿͜H̶̬̊È̷̡ ̸̜̋M̸̮̔O̷̜͒U̶͇̓S̵̺̏Ë̵̝́). On top of that, it's the only main MCU superhero that they've recast (so far). Conversely though, it's actually (surprisingly) a good movie.

Plotwise, it actually for the most part skips over the 'how the Hulk became the Hulk' bit, dropping into him trying to gain control over his form. 

Castingwise, I actually really like Edward Norton as the Hulk. He does the smart scientist struggling to maintain control (and not always doing so well) really well. And the transformation into the Hulk is quite the constrast. As much as I love Mark Ruffalo, I think Norton really could have carried the role. So it goes. 

Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky is... just strange. I don't really understand his motivation in the film. He does seem slightly unhinged, which makes it work though. Liv Tyler is a bit of an odd choice. I think that's been my reaction to her in just about everything she's in. She doesn't seem hugely emotive and I don't feel ever really fits with Norton, but it's not the worst.  

My favorite minor character: Tim Blake Nelson as the scientist/mad doctor Sterns trying to help the Hulk is wonderful. It's hard to get over O Brother, Where Art Thou, but in the end, I think he really pulls it off. 

Overall, it's weaker than Iron Man (and the weakest movie I've seen thus far this year), but from a completionist standpoint, it's still well worth the watch.
