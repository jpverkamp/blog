How it's done, done, done

Well that was a delightful surprise. 

I’ve of course *heard* of KPop Demon Hunters, but I hadn’t really paid that much attention to it. 

And then one of the songs was suggested to me on YouTube. 

And another.

And they got stuck in my head. 

> Rumi: It is annoyingly catchy, though.

And then I finally watched it. 

I don’t know the last time a movie flew by quite that fast. There are probably a few points they could have gone just a bit more into, but really, it works. It’s basically a vehicle for the the songs… With a touch of story about keeping secrets from your friends and being true to yourself and all that. But mostly a vehicle for the songs. 

And it did that really well.

Take a listen. If you like the music, watch it. You’ll be glad you did!
