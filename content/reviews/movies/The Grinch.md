Perhaps it's nostalgia speaking, but I really miss the 1966 How the Grinch Stole Christmas! It was basically a reading of the book with a great narrator (Boris Karloff, who amusingly is best known for a bunch of 1930-40s horror films) and a few new songs that really fit the Seuss style. Given that the Grinch is probably in my top 5 Seuss books overall, of course I like it. 

This... is not quite that. It's modernized, Illuminationized (man that style is distinct), and ads a bunch of strange backstory to pad the runtime. It's not bad by any stretch of the imagination, and it's better at least than the 2000 Jim Carrey Version... but I don't really think it's something that needs to be. 

I will say that I really do enjoy getting GBenedict Cumberbatch as the Grinch. He's got a great voice for it!

So far... the best movie of the year! Because it's the only movie of the year. I expect that will fall.
