Another on that list of movies I'm a little surprised I'd never seen before--yet I've seen enough random clips on YouTube shorts at this point that I feel like I have. 

(Side note: This also came back to mind since Ben Stiller wrote a good amount of [[Severance]]() of all things.)

In any case, it's a ridiculous and fun movie. The whole premise--that a magical artifact somehow animates all the exhibits at the museum every night--yet somehow no one has ever noticed this? Doesn't make the list bit of sense. But that doesn't make it any less fun!

> Easter Island Head: HEY!  
> [pauses]  
> Easter Island Head: Dum-dum.  
> Larry: Yes?  
> Easter Island Head: You give me gum-gum!  
> Larry: I give you gum-gum?  
> Easter Island Head: You new Dum-dum. You give me gum-gum.  
> Larry: Gee, okay, you know what? I have no gum-gum. Sorry. And my name isn't Dum-dum. My name's Larry.  
> Easter Island Head: No, your name Dum-dum.  
> [some people are running away]  
> Easter Island Head: Oh, you in trouble, Dum-dum. You better run-run. From Attila the Hun-hun.  
> [Attila yells and chases Larry]  
> Easter Island Head: See you later, Dum-dum!  

There are a lot of fun action scenes in the movie. Just don't think about it all too hard and enjoy the ride. I especially loved the chaos of the dioramas of thousands of tiny men come to life and fighting one another. :smile: 

> Jedediah: No problemo, Gigantor.  
> Larry: Um, my name's Larry, first of all okay, Jed? See, I call you Jed, I don't call you tiny, right?  
> Jedediah: What's that supposed to mean?  
> Larry: Hey teeny, how does that sound?  
> Jedediah: I... I don't like it. It hurts my feelings.  
> Larry: Okay, well Gigantor makes me feel like some sort of freak.  
> Octavius: I don't. I just call you Larry.  
> Larry: Don't be a kiss-ass.  

The casting in this movie is a big strength! Dick Van Dyke was a lot of fun as old former night watchman Cecil. Robin Williams (RIP :sad:) is always a delight and his Teddy Roosevelt was no exception. Rami Malek is certainly no [[Mr. Robot]](), but he's got a perfect presence as Ahkmenrah. And Steve Coogan as Octavius and Owen Wilson's Jedediah were hilarious (especially since the latter was originally a minor cameo). 


And you know? Apparently 'The real-life American Museum of Natural History had 20% more visitors during the holiday season following this movie's opening.' So good on them!

Now the sequels? No idea where they go from here, but you know what? Worth a try!
