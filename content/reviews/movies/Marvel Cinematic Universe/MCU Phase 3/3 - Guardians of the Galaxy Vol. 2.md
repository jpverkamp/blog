After the surprisingly awesome {{< crosslink "Guardians of the Galaxy" >}}, it was really a question of: could they do it again? The answer, a resounding... sort of?

Don't get me wrong, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 has some pretty awesome moments. The opening battle in particular is spectacular (I love the contrast of dancing Baby Groot against a big smack down in the background). And we get all piles of additional humor based around Drax's literalness, Rocket being a racoon, ...


> Drax: The beast's hide is too thick to be pierced from the outside. I must cut through it from the inside.
> 
> Gamora: Huh?... No, no! Drax, wait a minute! *Drax*!
> 
> [Drax charges at the monster, and leaps down its throat]
> 
> Peter Quill: [horrified] What is he doing?
> 
> Gamora: He said the skin is too thick to be pierced on the outside. So he...
> 
> Peter Quill: But, that doesn't make any sense!
>
> Gamora: I tried telling him that!
> 
> Peter Quill: Skin is the same level of thickness from the inside as from the outside!
> 
> Gamora: I *realize* that.

... and Groot being... whatever he is. 

> Gef: [about Baby Groot] What about this little plant? Can I smash it with a rock?
> 
> Taserface: No, Gef. It's too adorable to kill. Take it to the tailor.

That being said, it's in kind of a weird place. On one hand, they're still scoundrels, but also heroes? And they're helping people but also stealing things. It's a contrast in general on what it means to be a Guardian of the Galaxy and I think it doesn't quite work. When they all go their separate ways, you know it's going to happen, but it doesn't really feel earned. Let them be a team for a little bit longer...

Plotwise, it's interesting to dig a little more into what makes Quill special (and able in the first movie to hold an Infinity Stone for even as long as he did). Turns out his dad is ... a planet? And I thought a racoon/tree teamup was ridiculous. Anyways, Kurt Russell acts the heck out of his role. He's a perfect super powerful, charismatic being with questionable intentions. 


> Ego: I created what I imagined biological life to be like... down to the most minute detail.

> Drax: Did you make a penis?
> 
> Peter Quill: Dude!
> 
> Gamora: What is wrong with you?
> 
> Drax: If he's a planet, how could he make a baby with your mother? He would smush her!
> 
> Peter Quill: I don't need to hear how my parents...
> 
> Drax: Why? My father would tell the story of impregnating my mother every winter solstice.
> 
> Peter Quill: That's disgusting.
> 
> Drax: It was beautiful. You earthers have hang-ups.
> 
> Ego: Yes, Drax, I got a penis.
> 
> Drax: Ha! Thank you!
> 
> Ego: It's not half bad.

But it's just a *really* weird plotline, even for the MCU. 

Storywise though, it was really interesting to see the increasing emphasis on relationships. Quill and Gamora have a weird one, but it's growing. Rocket and Quill fight all the time. Quill has some major daddy issues (with literal daddy-planet Ego, but also with adopted daddy Yondu). Etc. It feels like they're trying to do a lot there--to the point of perhaps being too much even--but I really do like the idea they were going for, especially with Yondu. That...

> [Yondu is floating in the air, hanging on his arrow]

> Peter Quill: You look like Mary Poppins.
> 
> Yondu: Is he cool?
> 
> Peter Quill: Hell yeah, he's cool.
> 
> Yondu: I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!

That was a satisfying plotline.

Overall, it's an enjoyable enough movie, if a bit bigger than it could support. Towards the bottom of my lists for the MCU/year. It's not a movie I would randomly pick out of the MCU to watch by itself, but definitely well above the level where I'd just skip it. 

Random side note: After watching so much Stargate over the last few months, hearing Ben Browder as the Sovereign Admiral was amusing. He has a somewhat distinct voice.
