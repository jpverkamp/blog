> President Thaddeus Ross: When a Celestial mass emerged in the Indian Ocean, we did what we often do. We squabbled over it. Countries rushed in to claim it as their own, setting up research facilities to exploit its resources. What was found inside that island is nothing short of the discovery of the millennium. Its potential applications in tech, in medicine, in defense are immeasurable. It's even more indestructible than vibranium. And it's not controlled by an isolationist nation. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you adamantium.

So. We're going to not only finally deal with that mess from [[Eternals]](), but we're also going to finally get in universe adamantium? Interesting strategy. 

In any case, we have a new Captain America. I wasn't sure Anthony Mackie could head a movie in [[The Falcon and the Winter Soldier]]() (or S2 of [[Altered Carbon]]() for that matter), but I actually quite enjoyed him this time around. I think Danny Ramirez / Joaquin Torres / the new Falcon really helped with that. 

Otherwise, we have Harrison Ford taking over for William Hurt as Ross. I'm... still surprised when I see Harrison Ford still being quite as active an actor as he is. It was already slightly odd in Kindom of the Crystal Skull... and that was more than 15 years ago. 

Overall, a step up from the recent spate of Marvel movies/TV. Hnoestly, it's been probably since [[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]() or [[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]()... Still, a decent action flick?

Onward!

Political note:

> Standing next to the President--even if it's Ross--it gives people hope. 

Came out in Feb 14, 2025, so this line was added *at the **very** latest* in January. 

> This is bullshit, and you know it.
> 
> This is politics.

Also, I get this reference:

> President Thaddeus Ross: [to Sam] That shield belongs in a museum!

It's funny, 'cause it's [[Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark|Harrison Ford]]().
