Upside: It's visually super colorful and weird and it's got a lot of potential for the new MCU Phase 5!

Downside: It's ... weird and chaotic and doesn't really fit with anything else we particularly know. 

Overall, it's ... fine? I enjoyed watching it, but it's in the category of MCU films that I doubt I'd watch again unless I'm doing a full rewatch (which is getting to be quite the endeavor).

For a bit more, it's kind of fascinating to find an entire huge world in the MCU that apparently *no one* we've talked to has known about (or at least seen fit to tell any of the main characters about). I get that it's super weird and that it takes rather a lot of effort to get there (in theory; in practice, they just keep doing it). But really? And there are millions (billions) of new sentients about. Weird. 

But on the other hand, I suppose it's a way that we can actually get Kang the Conqueror into the main MCU universe without him just sort of ruining everyone's day. It's the first time since Loki and later Thanos honestly that I've actually felt like the MCU is building up to something. Jonathan Majors as Kang does have some major villain energy going on...

> Scott Lang: Um, I don't know who you are, but you've made a big mistake. I'm an Avenger. I've called the other Avengers...  
> Kang The Conqueror: Oh, you're an Avenger. Have I killed you before?  
> Scott Lang: What?  
> Kang The Conqueror: They all blend together after a while. You're not the one with the hammer, are you?  
> Scott Lang: That's Thor. We get confused a lot, similar body type.  

...which is going to be a bummer, depending on how his real life legal issues shake out. It wouldn't be the end of the world to recast him though, I suppose? 

Castingwise (and speaking of recasting), I did also really enjoy Kathryn Newton as Cassie Lang. Three different actors now in four different films. But now that she actually has a major role, I hope she sticks around; she's a decent young mirror of Paul Rudd's Ant-Man. 

Other than that... it's really weird to me that Janet *never mentioned* a thing about the Quantum Realm being heavily populated. She was there for decades and it just never came up when she was back? Trauma and not wanting to talk about any of the finer details, I do get. And I suppose that's the answer really. Any hint at what was down there and they'd never keep Hank and co out. But still. Feels weird. 

Overall, as I mentioned, a midtier MCU film with potential for Phase 5. Worth watching at least once if you're into the MCU thing.
