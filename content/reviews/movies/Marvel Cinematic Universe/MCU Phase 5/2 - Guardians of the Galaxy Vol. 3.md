> Rocket: Someday I'm gonna make great machines that fly. And me and my friends are gonna go flying together, into the forever and beautiful sky.

Well that was fun. If you liked the previous two Guardians of the Galaxy entries (or especially the Holiday Special), I expect you'll love this. If you didn't care for them, there's a chance! 

<!--more-->

Plotwise, it's really the Rocket story. We get backstory (oh the feels), a rescue mission (found family!), and the closing action. It's good times and really does I think frame what the Guardians are all about: family. Messy, twisted, and weird as anything family. 

Characterwise, the Guardians are great. I could have used more Rocket (ironic in a movie primarily about him). Drax and Mantis are fun together. I like the learning-to-be-human Nebula and Quill and Gamora relearning about each other. 

And we have Will Poulter as Adam Warlock. Who was most definitely there. Soaring in to an epic soundtrack! That was a strange introduction to a new character I believe they expect to stick around. 

The real star of the show though? Chukwudi Iwuji as The High Evolutionary. Man. He does crazy well. I wonder if they can tie him in to Kang somehow. 

Visualwise, oh it's colorful. And squishy. And distrubing at times. I like seeing how weird and wonderful (and squishy; did I mention squishy) the MCU can get out in space. It's interesting seeing this whole wide universe out there. 

Musicwise, not nearly as strong as the first two volumes. I like that they're moving through time, but there were so many more iconic 90s songs they could have used. Perhaps they couldn't pay enough to get the rights? Or just chose not to? 

In any case, like I said. A solid entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a worthy third/conclusion to the Guardians of the Galaxy, and one of my favorite movies of the year. 

Onward!
