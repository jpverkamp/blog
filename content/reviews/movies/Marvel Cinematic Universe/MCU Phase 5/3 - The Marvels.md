You know, for the first half of the movie, that was actually a lot of fun. 

> Then why did you touch it?  
> Because it was glowing and mysterious.  
> Okay new rule - No touching shit  
> I’m getting a lot of negative energy from you and I don’t need that right now.  

Chaos ensues and bad decisions mean that the Marvels ([[Ms. Marvel]](), [[Captain Marvel]](), and... the other one? (Monica Rambeau, most recently from [[WandaVision]]())) are now suddenly swapping places across time and space. It doesn't *really* make any sense, but it's fun to watch!

And then... the whole thing starts going off the rails. 

Why don't they have help? Why does Ms. Marvel even wear that bangle? 

And... seriously? A planet where they *sing* instead of speak and can't understand if you don't sing? That's a comics silly reason; it just feels weird on the big screen. 

And what in the *world* is with those Flerken scenes... It's already the shortest movie in the MCU. Did they just really not have enough content so they had to pad it with *something*? 

Overall, it was almost there, but like much of the MCU for... a while now. It could have been so much better. 

Onward.
