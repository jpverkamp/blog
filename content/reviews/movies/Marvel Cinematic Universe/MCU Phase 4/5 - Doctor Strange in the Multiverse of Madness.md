So. That's what what you get if you take a [director best known for his horror movies](/reviews/directors/sam-raimi)[^spiderman] and let them loose in the MCU. 

I like it. :smile:

<!--more-->

It's certainly got a whole heap more dark and twisted imagery than anything else in the MCU, from a number of heroes being murdered to a blood (could be oil) covered baddie, to the next best thing to a souls-of-the-damned powered zombie super hero... It's dark. There's no doubt about it. 

But on the other hand, we also get some fascinating character building for the MCU. Turns out Wanda *didn't* learn from [[WandaVision]](). And Strange is still messing with the Multiverse--this was apparently supposed to come out before [[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]()), that would have been strange[^strange]--but seeing how he grows throughout the movie (in spite or perhaps because of the mistakes of other Stranges), but in the end... he's still corrupt. 

Oooh, and the visuals. [[Doctor Strange]]() has always done some pretty visually crazy things, but this really takes it up a level. From jumping between some really weird universes to seeing a few worlds post shattering... cool. Very cool.

Castingwise, Cumberbatch is great, Olsen is wonderfully creepy, and Wong is hilarious. I'm glad to see more of McAdams as Dr. Palmer, with at least a bit more to do.Pretty much as expected. I'm really impressed with newcomer Xochitl Gomez as America Chavez, I think she'll do good. Seeing the alternate universe heroes was great fun, even if they could have done more--especially {{<spoiler>}}Atwell's Carter in live action!{{</spoiler>}}[^well]. Oy, {{<spoiler>}}Patrick Stewart has gotten old though... still good to see him{{</spoiler>}}. I think I agree with many that the weakest was {{<spoiler>}}John Krasinski as Reed Richards{{</spoiler>}}. He just... didn't feel like that much of a super hero. 

Overall, a solid entry to the universe and I'm glad to see them doing all sorts of interesting things. Of the MCU, I'd put it top of middling. For this year, about the same.

[^strange]: Pun not intended... but appreciated. 

[^well]: *live* action. Heh.
