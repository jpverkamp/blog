Finally got around to watching this. I'm so glad I did, it's hilarious and an aboslute blast of nostalgia. Similar to {{<crosslink "Avengers: Endgame">}}, I don't know know if this would possibly hold up without the weight of all of the movies that came before it (I doubt it), but with that weight--it's really really good. 

It's funny, it's touching, and there are some really crazy action scenes. But the greatest strength of course comes from {{<spoiler>}}bringing back a half dozen villains and all three modern live action Spider-Men into one film{{</spoiler>}}. Would anyone have believed something that crazy possible, especially before Infinity War/Endgame? I doubt it. But it's quite satisfying. 

More comments [after the rankings]({{< ref "#a-few-random-comments-spoilers" >}}). 

Speaking of which, it might fade on a rewatch, but for now, this is right up there at the top of my favorite of the Marvel movies, which surprised me. It is right up in second for the year--I have to leave Encanto in the top spot as it's been absolutely stuck in my head for weeks now.

## A few random comments \***SPOILERS**\*

### Things that were AWESOME!

* Daredevil!

    > Matt Murdock: You may have dodged your legal troubles but things will get much worse. There's still the court of public opinion.
    > 
    > [Matt catches a brick thrown through the window]
    > 
    > Peter Parker: How did you just do that?
    > 
    > Matt Murdock: I'm a really good lawyer.

    Charlie Cox has been a wonderful Daredevil. I'm glad to have him back, even if it didn't amount to much (especially if you didn't previously know who he was...)

* Spider-Men! Spider-Mans? Spiders-Men? Anyways.

    > Peter Parker (Garfield): Are you okay?
    > 
    > Peter Parker (Macguire): Oh, my back. It's kinda stiff from all the swinging I guess.
    > 
    > Peter Parker (Garfield): Oh yeah, no, I got a middle back thing too.
    > 
    > Peter Parker (Macguire): Really?
    > 
    > Peter Parker (Garfield): Yeah. You want me to crack it?
    > 
    > Peter Parker (Macguire): Yeah. Yeah, that'd be great.

    It's great to both see them each again, to see the interactions, and to acknowledge that (in Maguire's case), it's been a few years. 

    Plus, you get lines like this:

    > Peter Parker (Holland): No no, it's OK. These are my friends. This is Peter Parker and this is Peter Parker. He's Spiderman, he's Spiderman. They're mes from other universes. This is the wizard I was telling you about. 

* Ned getting a power up! I hope we get to see more of Ned's magic powers in the future. 

* Callbacks! So many callbacks!

    > Max Dillon: What do you mean fix us?
    > 
    > Peter Parker: Look, our technology is advanced...
    > 
    > Norman Osborn: I can help you. You know, I'm something of a scientist myself. Octavius knows what I can do. 

    It's great to see all the villains back, but even better to have lines like that. Or this:

    > Otto Octavius: [Holding an Arc Reactor] The power of the sun...
    > 
    > Peter Parker: ...in the palm of your hand. 

    Or of course:

    > Peter Parker (Holland): She told me that with great power...
    > 
    > Peter Parker (Macguire): Comes great responsibility.
    > 
    > Peter Parker (Holland): Wait, what? How do you know that?
    > 
    > Peter Parker (Garfield): Uncle Ben said it.
    > 
    > Peter Parker (Macguire): The day he died. Maybe she didn't die for nothing, Peter.

### Things that were less awesome

* Doctor Strange. He's absolutely awesome, but I really didn't get his motivation here. And given that the core of the plot revolves around what he does / why... 

    > [Peter arrives at the Sanctum Sanctorum]
    > 
    > Doctor Strange: So, Peter... to what do I owe the pleasure?
    > 
    > Peter Parker: I'm sorry to bother you, sir.
    > 
    > Doctor Strange: Please. We've saved half the universe together. I think we're beyond you calling me "sir".
    > 
    > [conjures flames in a fireplace]
    > 
    > Peter Parker: Okay. Stephen...
    > 
    > Doctor Strange: [beat] That feels weird, but I'll allow it.

* MJ feels underused. She's not quite as weirdly over snarky in the first film, but I feel like she could have done more. Ned got upgrades and feels like he'll be back. MJ mostly feels like ... the girlfriend. Having Garfield's Parker get a chance to save her was cool though.
