So James Cameron has been doing that whole water thing for quite a while, eh? 

I actually thought this was a horror movie. Taking a look at the marketing material and the cover, I think you might see why. And really, there’s a lot of tension to it. A crew trapped deep under the ocean. The darkness and the pressure barely held at bay, readying to come in and crush them all given a chance. 

It’s terrifying enough, even without any deep see monsters or whatnot. 

> Bud: When it comes to the safety of these people, there's me and then there's God, understand?

Throw into that mankind’s worst enemy—mankind itself? 

And that’s quite the adventure/thriller. It’s just not a horror movie. 

I love the setting, the characters give you reasons to care, and the stakes are a lot of fun. The ending does get a bit woohoo/cheesy, but I suppose it had to go somewhere. 

This definitely goes on the long list of ‘there’s a reason why people still remember/recommend this movie almost 40 years later’. It’s a solid underwater sci fi classic and I’m glad to have watched it. 

Onward!
