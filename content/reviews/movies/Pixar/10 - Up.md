Whelp. That's one major tear jerker of an intro. And it doesn't even need words. 

The rest of the movie is a pretty fun romp of an adventure as well. The old man, too old for this crap / young boy just trying so very hard to do the right thing is great; the talking collars and how dogs think is hilarious; and the adventurey bits are solid and almost too exciting (depending on the age of the viewers). 

A solid Pixar, well worth watching.
