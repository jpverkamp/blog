For me, [[Toy Story]]() falls at just the right time for a blast of nostalgia. It came out when I was a kid and I watched it over and over again. Somehow, Toy Story 2, despite only coming out 4 years later, just doesn't hit the same mark. Don't get me wrong, it's still a good fun movie and worth watching, but... it's just not quite as good.

I do love the initial cast, but there are a number of new additions that work out well: Joan Cusack as Jessie is great. Having a Mrs. Potato Head, also great. The best part is probably Wayne Knight as (baddie toy collector, how often do you get to say that?) Al McWhiggin. I didn't realize who that was, but hearing his voice... yeah that's so very Nedry from Jurassic Park

Overall, worth an occasional watch and I think the children enjoyed it, but certainly not in the category of rewatchable over and over again.
