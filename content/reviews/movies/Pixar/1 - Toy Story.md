Oh Toy Story. A solid animated kids' film that started Pixar's decade's long line of wonderful animated films. It's a great film that for the most part holds up even now. Well worth the re-watch. 

I do love the humor. HTe interplay between Tim Allen's Buzz and Tom Hanks' Woody. Absolutely great.

> Buzz: Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is "Space Ranger".

> Woody: The word I'm searching for - I can't say, because there's preschool toys present.

The animation for the time was absolutely impressive--but they really did make the right choice in animating toys as the main characters. The plastic slightly odd movements really work for toys--for the few human characters and dogs... less so. It's still acceptable now. 27 year old (wow) technology and all that. 

I think I'm going to try to work through all of Pixar's movies this year. So far, I think I prefer Finding Nemo, but not by much.

Over the year... Toy Story shows it's age. It's still very very good, don't get me wrong.
