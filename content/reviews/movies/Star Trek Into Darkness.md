A few years ago, I decided that I was doing myself a disservice as a self-identified geek[^1]: of Star Trek, I'd only seen Voyager and a few of the movies. Of course I had to remedy that fact. :smile:

Over the course of a summer, I watched it all[^2]. 10 movies. 3 seasons of {{< wikipedia page="Star Trek: The Original Series" text="The Original Series" >}}; 7 seasons each of {{< wikipedia page="List of Star Trek: The Next Generation episodes" text="The Next Generation" >}}, {{< wikipedia page="List of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episodes" text="Deep Space Nine" >}}, and {{< wikipedia page="List of Star Trek: Voyager episodes" text="Voyager" >}}[^3]; and finally the 4 seasons of {{< wikipedia page="Star Trek: Enterprise" text="Enterprise" >}}. Yet, I still don't consider myself a Trekkie ({{< wikipedia page="Trekie#Trekkie vs. Trekker" text="or a Trekker" >}}).

I guess my entire point is that I do have at least a bit of a leg to stand on when talking about the new Star Trek movies. That being said, feel free to ignore me. :smile: Everyone has their own opinion and I've certainly seen the entire spectrum when it comes to this movie...

Overall, I really liked it.

On the negative side, the pacing was pretty bad at times, with long slow stretches that just didn't feel like they needed to be there[^4]. There were a few scenes that just seemed so strange, particularly <a itemprop="url" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1404408/?ref_=tt_cl_t11">Alice Eve's</a> underwear scene[^5]. Still, the action scenes were nicely "actiony" and the scenery looked amazing, both the shine of the ship and the destruction of the later acts.

As many people the internet over have said, there were more than a few *'huh'* moments that really fought against my suspension of disbelief. Without getting too spoilery: Isn't saving the natives in the first place a violation of the {{< wikipedia "Prime Directive" >}}? Other than looking cool, why didn't they just wait in space? Later on, why did they go to Kronos in the first place? And why did it only take them about 30 seconds to get back? And for that matter, where was the rest of Starfleet when they did get back? Does the doctor make a habit of randomly injecting things? And why *his* blood specifically, not his crew's? ... Yeah. I'm done. It's a good thing I don't really think of myself as a Trekkie or a lot of that would drive me even more up the wall. :smile:

You know what my biggest nit to pick with the movie was though? J.J. Abrams' marketing. Everyone who knew Trek knew *exactly* who <a itemprop="url" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1212722/?ref_=tt_cl_t7">Cumberbatch</a> was playing no matter how hard they tried to deny it... The only people who wouldn't know wouldn't care. Sigh.

Like I said though, for a summer action flick, it was a rather enjoyable movie. Barring the aforementioned marketing, there were a few neat twists. There were more than a handful of callbacks to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084726/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2">The Wrath of Khan</a>, which was nice at first, although it a bit old by the end[^6]. The action was nice and the characters are actually starting to finally feel like a crew now. <a itemprop="url" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0704270/?ref_=tt_cl_t2">Zachary Quinto</a>, <a itemprop="url" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0881631/?ref_=tt_cl_t4">Karl Urban</a>, and <a itemprop="url" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0670408/?ref_=tt_cl_t5">Simon Pegg</a> all carried over strong performances from the first film. I can't really get into <a itemprop="url" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1517976/?ref_=tt_cl_t1">Chris Pine</a> as Kirk, but then again I never really liked the original Kirk either. But really? <a itemprop="url" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1212722/?ref_=tt_cl_t7">Benedict Cumberbatch</a> carried the show. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1475582/">Sherlock</a> just jumped up rather a few places up my TV queue[^7].

Despite my earlier grumbling, I really did enjoy the movie. It's not quite up to the level of {{<crosslink "Iron Man 3">}} and I still think {{<crosslink "The Croods">}} was more fun, but I have no problem putting it into the #3 spot. If you have the time, I'd say it's worth seeing.

[^1]: Is there any other kind?
[^2]: Yes, in order
[^3]: Still my favorite. Feel free to tell me how I'm ~~wrong~~ right in the comments
[^4]: Although it was a later showing than I generally go, so that might have played a role
[^5]: Which even Damon Lindelof <a href="http://io9.com/damon-lindelof-admits-the-star-trek-nudity-was-gratuit-508967420">has said</a> was "gratuitous"
[^6]: The inverted Kirk/Spock yell was particularly weird...
[^7]: Also, did you know he was in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903624/">The Hobbit</a> as the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000156">Necromancer</a>? The more you know!
