Apparently {{< wikipedia "Jeff Bridges" >}}.as been trying to have The Giver turned into a movie for the better part of two decades. Originally, he wanted to have {{< wikipedia page="his father" text="Lloyd Bridges" >}}.n the eponymous role. He even apparently went so far as to have a version filmed somewhere, although so far as I know that version has never been made publically available.

I wonder if that one diverged so much from the book?

Now don't get me wrong. It's been rather a while since I've read the book. But there seemed to be rather a few minor changes. Most of them were fine; for example, I didn't mind that his first memory of pain wasn't a sunburn. But the ending was a bit rocky. After a certain point, I just kept expecting the film to be over. Eventually they got back on the rails, but it took a while.

One good part at least was that I think <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000313">Jeff Bridges</a> was actually pretty good as The Giver. Just gruff and no-nonsense enough. He didn't have the odd accent from [[R.I.P.D.]]().nd for once he didn't feel like another incarnation of {{< wikipedia page="the dude" text="The Big Lebowski" >}}. Also, it was interesting to see Taylor Swift in a film role, especially given that I didn't even know it was her until the credits.

Overall, I've seen worse movies. If this wasn't *the* film adaptation The Giver (given it took 20 years to make this one, we won't likely see another), I was hoping for more. What exactly, I couldn't tell you, but something more.
