> Edgin: We must never stop failing, because the minute we do, we've failed.

Oh, that's such a fun movie. It takes the delightful chaos of an idolized Dungeons and Dragons session, leans hard into the worldbuilding of the Forgotten Realms (without strictly requiring you know anything about it); and cranks up the visuals up to 11. 

There's gobs of humor, some pretty crazy action scenes, and a big 'evil skybeam' action scene that every movie nowdays seems to have. Really, there are just so many great individual scenes. The initial view of the prison--and the prison break. Fighting a certain dragon. Asking exactly five questions of the dead (it goes exactly as you'd expect). 

The characters and casting were really quite fun too. Chris Pine's Edgin the bard really sells teh movie, but I loved the over the top paladin feel of Regé-Jean Page's Xenk and Daisy Head's bonkers Sofina. Michelle Rodriguez as a barbarian? Yes please. Hugh Grant as Hugh Grant? A delightful surprise.  

It's great. Give it a watch. 

> Xenk: You may have forsworn your oath, but your oath hasn't forsworn you.  
> ...  
> Edgin: Just because that sentence is symmetrical, it doesn’t make it not nonsense.
