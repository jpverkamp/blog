# Temple of Doom

Temple of Doom has some major middle film issues going on. Both [[Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark|Raiders of the lost Ark]]() and [[todo:Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade|The Last Crusade]]() are far better films. That's not to say Temple of Doom is bad, just lesser. 

Actionwise, there's a ton. Gun fights, bailing out a plane, tons of bugs, several fights in a mine, and a giant drop? There is barely time to breathe. 

Real world ethicswise... this is even worse than Raiders, which is saying something. There are a fair few "that's... racist, isn't it?" moments and a helping of "are they just evil for the sake of bring evil?" I suppose one can always go with the "it's an action movie, don't worry about it" mindset. 

I will say though, this movie gets *dark*. Even compared to a certain face meltingly terrifying scene in Raiders, Temple of Doom is far worse. Younger viewers especially beware. 

Characterwise...

> Short Round: Wow! Holy Smoke! Crash landing!  
> Indiana Jones: Short Round, step on it.  
> Short Round: Okey dokey, Dr. Jones.  
> [turns his cap around]  
> Short Round: Hold on to your potatoes!  
> Willie: For crying out loud, there's a *kid* driving the car!  

While in general I think I prefer Marion to Willie, the dynamic between Jones, Short Round and Willie is delightful. The real heart of the movie. 

> Indiana Jones: Shorty!  
> [Indy shouts to Shorty in Chinese. Short Round, wide-eyed, nods and wraps a rope around his arm]  
> Short Round: Hang on lady, we going for a ride!  
> [Indy raises his sword, and Willie realizes]  
> Willie: Oh my god! Oh my God... Oh my God... Oh my God!  
> [wraps a rope around her arm]  
> Willie: Is he nuts?  
> Short Round: He no nuts. He's crazy!  
> Indiana Jones: Mola Ram! Prepare to meet Kali... in hell!  

They're just so much fun to listen to. A real "I can't believe this is happening either" sort of thing going on. 

Overall, like I said, the weakest of the three. Still a solid action flick! Onward!

Random side note: I've been (slowly) learning some Hindi. Actually being able to pick out a few words (mostly simple verbs) in some of those scenes was a lot of fun! (Although apparently the language in the village was a Sri Lankan one, since that's where it was actually filmed).
