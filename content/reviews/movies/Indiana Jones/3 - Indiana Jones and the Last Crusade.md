Oh, that's my favorite of teh trilogy by a solid margin. 

It's great! All the way from the introduction with a young Indy. The introduction of the whip. The hat. His love of snakes. 

From there, we get a big world trotting mystery with some great action scenes...

> Are you crazy? Don't go between them.  
> Go between them, are you crazy?

...big archeological puzzles...

> But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I".

...the dynamic between Indy and his father...

> I suddenly remembered my Charlemagne. Let my armies be the rocks and the trees and the birds in the sky.

...Nazis...

> I hate these guys.

...and a big supernatural finale.

> He choose... poorly. 

Oh it's a wonderful movie. 

Watch it!

Which of course means [[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]() is up next... hmm.
