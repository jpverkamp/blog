Dune: Part Two is a lot like [[Dune (Movie)|the first half]](). It's visually stunning and there are some intense scenes... but it still doesn't feel like a complete movie, even if this one actually does have a decent ending compared to the first. On to part 3 I suppose!

Scenewise, I love seeing the deserts. The sandworms. The Fremen's homes in the sand. 

Plotwise, it's Dune. he story is already a little messy to begin with, with the twisty politics and (planted) religious fervor building throughout the story. I felt like there were some odd editing choices here--plot points that just seemed to happen out of no where or cut off early, although I can't really put my finger on any in specific. 

Castingwise, the Harkonnens were quite a standout in this film. Stellan Skarsgard was great and Austin Butler was just about as terrifying as he was meant to be. 

Christopher Walken as the Emperor? So much potential, but he just ... doesn't have much presense. I suppose that could have been intentional, but it feels wasted. Florence Pugh, likewise, as Princess Irulan. I expect she'll have more role in part three. I did love new addition Javier Bardem as Stilgar though. 

And Timothée Chalamet--I think he was even stronger this time around. He's go the impact Paul needed in this movie. 

Overall, a movie worth watching (if you've seen part one of course :smile:). I'm still looking forward to the now upcoming part three!

> Gurney Halleck: My lord, the great houses have answered. They refuse to honor your ascendency.  
> Stilgar: We await your orders, Lisan al-Gaib.  
> Paul Atreides: Lead them to paradise.
