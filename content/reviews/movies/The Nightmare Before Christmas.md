Man I love this movie. 

<!--more-->

It's got awesome visuals, just creepy enough while still being delightfully fun. 

It's got awesome music:

{{< spotify album="4YF2FhoRfaTLv2sMVLUrJm" >}}

I have the whole thing on my playlist. And what's even more awesome? There's a collection of the songs done by various well known artists in their own signature styles. I particularly love Marilyn Manson's creepy *This Is Halloween* and Flyleaf doing *What's This*:

{{< spotify album="4Usx75m9IrKX0GBL8y6XZr" >}}

It's got a fun (if not entirely unique) story, with the whole 'saving Christmas' vibe going on. 

Overall, it's one of my favorite movies of all time. Well worth a spot in my top movies for the year. :D
