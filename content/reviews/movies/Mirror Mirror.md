Mirror Mirror was cute enough for a retelling of that old Snow White story, but I don't think it has quite the strength to stand on cuteness alone. Visually, it's beautiful, but that's all it is. It feels like a series of set pieces each of them self satisfied in a rather distracting manner.

At times, it got to the point of feeling remarkably silly--and not realy in a good way. I think that the best example of that were the flashing teeth.

Really, that's all I have to say about it. I guess it might be a decent movie for the younger crowd, say tweens. But just based on enjoyability alone, I'll put it last for the year.
