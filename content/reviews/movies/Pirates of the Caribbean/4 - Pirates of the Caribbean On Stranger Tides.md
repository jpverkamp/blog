Pirates of the Caribbean... without Bloom or Knightly? At least they still have Johnny Depp I suppose. And Barbossa--ish. 

Easily the weakest of the series. It's... fine, but it doesn't have the absolutely bonkers charm of the earlier movies.

The good points: 

* PenÃ©lope Cruz as Angelica is pretty great. Especially trying to impersonate Jack Sparrow. 

    > Angelica: You were the only pirate I thought I could pass for.
    > 
    > Jack Sparrow: That is NOT a compliment.

* Ian McShane as Blackbeard is a delightful villain. I'd put him right up there with Blackbeard. And he's got a great ship, as much a character as himself. 

    > Jack Sparrow: [after the mutiny is victorious] The ship is ours!
    > 
    > Blackbeard: [comes out of his quarters and glares at Sparrow] Gentlemen. I be placed in a bewilderment. There I were, resting. And upon a sudden, I hear an ungodly row on deck. Sailors abandoning their posts, without orders, without leave. Men before the mast, taking the ship for themselves. What be that, First Mate?
    > 
    > Angelica: Mutiny, Captain.
    > 
    > Blackbeard: [holding his hand to his ear] Again?
    > 
    > Angelica: Mutiny!
    > 
    > Blackbeard: Aye, mutiny. And what fate befall mutineers? Now, we know the answer to that, do we not? Mutineers... HANG!
    > 
    > [raises his enchanted sword, making the sails drop, and the rigging ensnare all the mutineers]
    > 
    > Jack Sparrow: [hangs upside down in front of Blackbeard] Captain, I wish to report a mutiny. I can name fingers and point names.
    > 
    > Blackbeard: Perfect.

* The idea that the Spanish are after the Fountain of Youth {{<spoiler>}}to destroy it, because only God grants eternal life{{</spoiler>}} is a great moment. 

The less great points:

* The whole scene running from King George towards the beginning is ... a bit overdone. I love when Jack Sparrow is the epitome of chaos, but there's a point that it just doesn't work. 

* The whole Preacher + mermaid love interest line... doesn't really work. The mermaids are better as straight up monsters, in my opinion. 

Overall... it's fine? The first three were such great movies that I really was hoping for more, but it's still an amusing watch.
