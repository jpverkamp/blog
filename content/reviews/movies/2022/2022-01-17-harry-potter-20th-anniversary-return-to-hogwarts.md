You know... I should really re-watch those movies. 

As I expect is the case for many in roughly my age bracket, Harry Potter was a huge part of my life growing up. I think I got into it with the release of the 3rd or 4th book (can't quite remember) and absolutely devoured each book after that the night it came out. I watched all of the movies a number of times. It was absolutely fascinating watching the characters in this other world basically growing up with me. 

And now... 20 years later.

On one hand, I really love seeing the interviews with both the main cast plus a number of the major supporting cast. It's just wonderful to see them again now, roughly the ages they would have been in the epilogue--although as they say, they look better in real life. 

Even better, the sets. They used the real movie sets, now part of the Harry Potter Studio Tour (in England), which made it all the more magical. They really did feel like being back in the movie. 

I think my favorite part were the little memories and trivia that has probably been released other places, but that I haven't really heard myself. Emma Watson being told left and right now to elegantly walk down to the Winter Ball--and falling down the stairs. A director/twin fight with broken ribs. The chaos of directing (initially) 11 year olds. A lot of fun there. 

Overall, it's a fun watch and well worth the time[^duh].

[^duh]: If you haven't seen the Harry Potter movies... perhaps watch those first?
