Poe is nuts. And a single fighter versus a dreadnaught... is kind of stupid. I get where General Leia is coming from. 
It works though, it fits who he is


> Luke: Who are you?



> They've tracked us through lightspeed
Why is that impossible? And since when is it lightspeed?


Badass Leia force flying moment... but she should not have survived that


Rey and Luke

> Make things float


I actually realy like the Rey/Kylo twist, that she's trying to turn him and that he's terribly conflicted. I don't know 100% how much of it is earned, but it works
I wish we knew more about Snoke. He just ... died. And all for what?
