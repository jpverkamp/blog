Star destroyer giving us the finger

The darker storm troops and a human element is pretty cool

Forked lightsaber and stopping a blaster bolt is awesome

Phasma is awesome and menacing

Scavenging the wreckage of those giant battles is pretty cool. Has to go somewhere. 

Finn and Poe are fun

> Because it’s the right thing to do
> You need a pilot
> I need a pilot

Finn just killing so many of his former fellows

Finn and Rey are fun

> We all look like this

> Stop holding my hand 

Millennium Falcon!

> The garbage will do

*The* Han Solo, old and running out of options is a nice touch. 

> Twice

Snope is awesome. 

> Your father… Han Solo

> The Jedi were real

> That’s why I’m handing it to you

Kylo worshipping Vader’s helmet is awesome

Bigger badder Death Star is awesome. Until it can fire on a pile of planets at once. 

Finn with a lightsaber! Random droid with a thing that blocks lightsabers?

> Hyper light speed weapon

> How do we blow it up. There’s always a way to do that. 

> Shields big gun

> That’s not how the force works

Kylo and Solo powerful but where is everyone

Final lightsaber dual is awesome. Should vanilla humans be able to do that? I guess so. 

End trip too quick and only sent two? Even if Chewie. Why Rey? Who is she?
