There is so much to love about this movie. 

Oh, I love the opening!

Then the Singapore scene is awesome. All the weapons. Knightly really sells that. 

The Bad Guy taken down by an even (at least if you're a pirate) worse guy--this one fully human... wonderful.

The World's End scene with Deep is awesome and unhinged. It really let's him fully Jack Sparrow. 

> Gentlemen, I wash my hands of this weirdness.

He's just great.

Exactly.

Seeing a huge gathering of Pirates, especially the nine Pirate Lords... Awesome. 

Overall, I love it all. I think the only real negative about the entire thing... is that final battle. It's absolutely spectacular, about as awesome as you can make a sea battle... except it's only the flagships. Everyone else just sits there. It could have been so much more... I know it would have been crazy expensive and complicated, but it bums me out a bit each time. 

Easily my favorite of the first three Pirates movies, but they're all very well worth watching.
