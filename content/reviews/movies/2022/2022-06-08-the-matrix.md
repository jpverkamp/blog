Oh the Matrix. This movie came out at just the perfect time for me--I wasn't into the counter culture as much, but even then I was messing around with computers and hacking--and I absolutely love every minute of it. It stands up even today, with a retrofuturistic sort of vibe that really still works even though it's been twenty years.

It's got a fascinating sort of philosophy that either doesn't entirely work or falls apart if you think about it too hard, but it's great.

> Morpheus: What is real? How do you define 'real'? If you're talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see, then 'real' is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain. 

Such an awesome cast as well. Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss of course as the badass hacker heroes. Laurence Fishburne acting the *heck* out of mysterious guru Morpheus. And oh Hugo Weaving makes a wonderful villain. Just in anything he's in. I like the other's on Morpheus' crew as well, Cypher and Mouse in particular. {{<spoiler>}}Wish we could have seen more of them somehow.{{</spoiler>}}

A great movie all around. 

> Morpheus: This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes. 

It's such a bummer that the whole red pill/blue pill thing has been co-opted by some of the darker/more twisted parts of internet culture. 

If you haven't seen it... I'm impressed. Give it a try. If you have and don't like it, I'd love to hear it.
