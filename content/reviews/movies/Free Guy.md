> Guy: I know this world is just a game, but this place, these people, that's all I have. So I'm not gonna be the good guy. I'm gonna be a great guy.

> Molotov Girl: [inhales] Wow, enjoy your lifetime supply of virginity.

Ryan Reynolds plays Ryan Reynolds playing a guy named Guy in a game--but he doesn't realize it. It's... a lot of fun. Once you get the basic idea, you've got pretty much the entire plot, but it's fun and well done.

Worth a watch.

Getting a bit more in depth, it's a bit weird seeing Ryan Reynolds in roles like this... he always feels basically the same. Very Deadpool. Not a bad thing, just a bit disconcerting at times. Other than that, the cop banter between Keys and Mouser is fun, and Millie makes a pretty good woman scorned, playing against Reynolds. And Taika Waititi... oh, Antwon, that's quite a character. 

Visualwise, the attention to details, with characters in the background doing character in teh background things is pretty amusing. Bumping into walls, crashing into invisible barriers. You know the thing. 

And of course final showdown--it's pretty much exactly what you'd expect, everyone watching on TVs all around the world. It doesn't make any sense--but it doesn't have to. It's a game! Movie? Game movie?!

Cute ending(s) too. :smile: Totally ignores the deeper ideas of AI vs free will--when you can literally have been programmed to love a specific someone. But ... perhaps that's not something that needs looked at just now.

And of course: 

> Guy: Millie, how many times a day are the banks robbed in your world?
> 
> Molotov Girl: Hardly ever, Guy.
> 
> Guy: What about corpses, Mille? Do ya see a lot of those? How many an hour?
> 
> Molotov Girl: None per hour, Guy.
> 
> Guy: What about gun violence? See a lot of gun violence in your world?
> 
> Molotov Girl: Actually, that's a big problem, Guy, it's a massive problem

Oy. 

> DUDE: Catchphrase!
