So I finally got to watch Logan. 

> Laura: You are dying. You want to die.  
> Logan: How do you know?  
> Laura: Charles told me.  
> Logan: What else did he tell you?  
> Laura: To not let you.  

It's a gritty, brutal sort of R rating that really lets you see the darker side of what a world with superpowers could be--without the twisted sort of humor that Deadpool has to take the edge off. The action is quick. It's bloody. And they ... don't hold back. It's not the sort of superhero movie that you may always want to see, but I think that it's one worth watching. At least once.

Even after all these years, I still can't imagine anyone other than Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. He made that role in live action and as Old Man Logan, he shines. Likewise, Patrick Stewart as an aged Charles Xavier. It's on the backs of the movies that came before that this one has as much punch as it does. Could they have done it without? Probably. Would it have been as good? Never. 

But the new start to the show? Dafne Keen as Laura / X-23? Holy crap. She was 11-12 when she filmed Logan and absolutely nails the role. Alternating dead to the world (from all she's been through) and a ruthless burning rage when she's fighting... I'm thoroughly impressed. 

I did also love Boyd Holbrook and Stephen Merchant. I'll I've seen the latter in is clips from Jojo Rabbit. I should watch that. 

In any case, a solid contender for #1 movie of the year. We'll have to see what else I'll get around to watching, but this one, this one I'm glad to have seen.
