That ... is a summer blockbuster. 

It's an absolutely bonkers plot. In a nutshell, the future is at war with the present (somehow) and there is technology that can 'invert' people and things so that they experience time backwards. How exactly that works and what exactly happens when you mess with the past/future is... never entirely clear. But it certainly does make for some absolutely crazy action scenes where some things are going forward, some backward, people are in the same scene more than once and...

Just go watch it. I doubt you'll end up figuring out exactly what was going on the entire time, but I don't really like it really matters that much. Just enjoy the spectacle. 

Side note: The constant usage of 'protagonist' was ... really weird. Just ignore it.
