Now that's music. I can only imagine hearing that on a theater scale sound system. Although my home sound bar certainly tried it's best... 

Anyways, I know I'm behind the times. Better late than never? 

Overall, it's a solid movie that tries to make some big points about everyone having value / sticking it to the people that hate you because you're different and... mostly hitting the mark? It gets even more complicated when you read up on Barnum's actual history. Very much a serial 'get rich quick'er with some questionable ethics, but there's good parts there as well.

> Jenny Lind: When you're careless with other people, Mr. Barnum... you bring ruin upon yourself.
> 
> P. T. Barnum: I have risked everything.
> 
> Jenny Lind: Well, so did I. And it seems we both lost.

And he/it does make for quite the story. 

> James Gordon Bennett: Tell me, Mr. Barnum, does it bother you that everything you're selling is fake?
> 
> P.T. Barnum: Do these smiles seem fake? It doesn't matter where they come from. The joy is real.
> 
> James Gordon Bennett: So you are a philanthropist?
> 
> P.T. Barnum: Well, hyperbole isn't the worst crime. Men suffer more from imagining too little than too much.
> 
> James Gordon Bennett: The creed of a true fraud.
> 
> P.T. Barnum: Mr Bennett, when was the last time you smiled? Or had a good laugh? A real laugh. A theater critic who can't find joy in the theater. Now who is the fraud? 

One random thought, it's interesting how Zendaya/Anne Wheeler and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II/W.D. Wheeler's biggest crime and reason to be in Barnum's act was... the color of their skin. On one hand, it was ... more subtle than I feel it should have been throughout the movie. On the other hand, the idea that that this is *still* a problem... Oy.

Random 'fun' fact:

> In January 2017, the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus announced that their doors were closing forever, due to decreasing attendance and growing public opposition to the circus's mistreatment of animals. Their last shows were in May 2017.

Oh the timing...
