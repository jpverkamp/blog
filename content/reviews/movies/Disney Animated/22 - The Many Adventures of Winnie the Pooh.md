The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh is just delightful--and a blast of nostalgia on top of that. I didn't manage to actually watch all of the Disney classic growing up (still haven't), but I definiately watched this one. And now, after reading many of the stories to my children, it's a delight to be able to share the video form with them as well!

I really like the style of these stories. It's a mix of animated world with the real storybook characters (Pooh et al), but also obviously in a book, as they hob from page to page. It's not the story of style you'd always expect to work, but it really works here.

My favorite story (that's not in any book I've read?):

Oh, I love that song. 

Random side note: I find it amusing that they removed getting Pooh down with a gun (and accidentally shooting him), probably to appease to Disney audiences... but they're perfectly fine to suggest blowing him up. And in the aforementioned Heffalumps... there's one right there. Fascinating. 

Overall, it holds up. It's a cute animated collection and a lot of fun to watch. 

Random fun fact (from IMDb): 

>  Tigger's trademark "Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!" laugh by was ad-libbed by Paul Winchell as well as his famous "TTFN: Ta-Ta For Now!" line, at the suggestion of his wife.

The only reason it's at the bottom of the Disney Animated rankings / as low as it is this year as it is? They're all so good!
