An almost 100 year old movie, based on a story likely at least a century older, combining aspects of stories who knows how old, animated for the modern (of the time) movie going audience. It's the beginning of a truely delightful era--that of the Disney animated classics. While they've certainly got their problems (the rather traditional gender roles and Disney's ongoing copyright battles to name a pair), they're still something elegant and innocent about them and Snow White is no exception.

One particular interesting aspect to look for is just how good the animation looks--for 1937 no less. It's been retouched a bit over the years and newer animation can do some absolutely amazing things, but as a piece of history? It's fantastic.
