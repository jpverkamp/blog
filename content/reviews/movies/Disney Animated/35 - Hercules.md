I somehow managed to never watch Hercules growing up. It just wasn't one of the Disney movies we ever had. 

Which is a bit of a bummer, since that's quite a good time! Better late than never though.

On the upside:

* Hercules is fun in a 'big dumb hero' role, but the real standout is Meg: oh she's fun. Snarky and biting and in the end, you're rootinf ro her all the same. 

* Hades is wonderful. He reminds me a lot of the Genie from Aladdin (5 years before)--and that's a good thing. 

* There are more than a handful of more subtle grown up jokes that I'm sure I wouldn't have gotten on a younger viewing. It's fun when they get those in. 

On the downside:

* This ... is not quite the stories you'd get in any other Greek myths. For the most part--it's fine. Just ignore it and go along for the ride. The one that bums me out the most is Hades being the villain. But... he makes a really good one? :smile: 

Overall, up near the top of Disney animated films I've rated thus far, especially among the old guard. Middle of the road for this year, but that's not a bad thing. I've just only seen a few good movies this year. :smile:

Onward!
