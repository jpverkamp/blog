Bambi is a surprisingly tricky movie to review, mostly since it relies on who's doing the reviewing. From my perspective, it's cute enough, but there's next to nothing there. It's just a bunch of cute animated animals running around for an hour. From my kids' perspectives though... they loved it. They were laughing out loud at the cartoon antics and cuddled right in during the storm and hunt scenes. 

Overall, it's a fun enough movie for kids to watch, but I think next time they request it, I'll find something else to do with my time. :smile:
