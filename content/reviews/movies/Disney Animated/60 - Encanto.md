Disney has really been doing quite well the last 12 years. Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen, Big Hero 6, Moana, and now Encanto? (I haven't seen Raya yet) All really solid films. Encanto specifically, I really enjoyed. It's got great songs, fun characters, beautiful animation, and a lovely story. It's fun to see a story based on yet another culture--Columbia this time--Disney is really doing that well. Overall, I wouldn't quite put it to the level of Moana, but it's just about there. 

A few general thoughts:

* The start is rough. They really do drop us into an awkward singing part (although to be fair the song is pretty fun by itself):

* *We Don't Talk About Bruno*, as an actual madrigal, is great.

    Just the character of Bruno in general. There are a few parts in that which toe the line as far as scaring the kids, which might be a problem. Great for me though. 

* *Surface Pressure* and the plot point around the stress of constantly saving the town is a fascinating plot and great in a kids' movie.

    It's okay not to be perfect. 

* Characterwise, I love the entire cast. Stephanie Beatriz as Mirabel nailed it, you can see her face in a few of the animations. John Leguizamo as Bruno Madrigal was great (as above). Diane Guerrero as Isabela Madrigal was as annoying as she should be at first and I loved seeing her transformation. Jessica Darrow as Luisa Madrigal was great (above again). María Cecilia Botero and Olga Måerediz as Abuela Alma Madrigal was a great basis for the family. Rhenzy Feliz as shapeshifter Camilo Madrigal--he had the most of the laugh out loud moments I had all day. Great times. Adassa as Dolores Madrigal with her chirping? Lovely. They're all great. 

* The house is a lot of fun. I thought the whole problem was it putting *so much energy* into those *ridiculous* bedrooms. 

* Can you imagine marrying into that family?

Overall, very fun movie, great soundtrack.
