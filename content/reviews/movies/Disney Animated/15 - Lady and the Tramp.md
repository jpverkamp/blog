That's a cute little movie. I think if you're going to do the dog thing, I would strongly prefer {{crosslink "One Hundred and One Dalmatians"}}. Better music, decent story. Could be that I watched the latter far more. 

But characterwise, I did enjoy the contrast between the titular Lady and the Tramp and it's a nice enough story. Stylistically, I enjoy the city and it's nice to not really see the human characters (it's a dog movie after all. 

Random weirdness... it's strange hearing the Beaver. He's totally Gopher from {{crosslink "The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"}}... which makes sense. It's the same voice actor for both. 

And hey, it's my favorite movie so far this year. :wink:

Random interesting factoid (via IMDb): 

> Walt Disney originally didn't want to include the 'Bella Notte' spaghetti-eating scene, now one of the most iconic moments in the whole Disney canon.
