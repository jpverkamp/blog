The first Thor was a bit disappointing. 

There, I said it.

It could certainly have been worse, but it really felt like the entire movie served solely to set up Thor[^1][^2] for the Avengers. It wasn't terrible, it just ... was.

Thor: The Dark world[^3] makes up for it. 

It takes Asgard and the nine realms in all their CGI mono-environmental glory[^4] a step further. It shows that even if the Asgardians are gods, that doesn't mean that they're immortal[^5]. It brings a bit of the science-fantasy edge to the Marvel Universe, nicely contrasting with the science of Iron Man and Thor and the blind patriotism of Captain America. It's a neat world, and could probably even stand on it's own[^6]. 

That's not to say that there weren't a few problems though.

Jane Foster ({{< wikipedia "Natalie Portman" >}}) still doesn't make sense. They had *one* weekend together[^7], then didn't see each other for years. 

Then there was {{< wikipedia "Christopher Eccleston" >}} as the big bad Malekith. He was just ... sort of there. Pretty much completely interchangeable. Sure, he can kick some Asguardian butt, but so can The Incredible Hulk. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Still. Pretty good. Pretty dang good. Of the Marvel Movies this year, I still liked Iron Man 3 better, but only just. They're both certainly worth a rewatching in a year and change when Avengers 2 comes out.
