Oh, that is a glorious movie. Exactly what an R rated half-satirical superhero movie should be. 

I haven't actually seen the first Suicide Squad or Birds of Prey (yet), so it's not quite as strange that they apparently kept some of the characters/actors while ignoring some events and keeping others. Other than that... it's just so enjoyable. 

Starting right from the opening:

{{< figure class="cover-image" src="/embeds/2021/suicide-squad-1.jpg" >}}

You have the Suicide Squad. Super powered criminals, given the chance to take a few years off their sentence if they'll use their powers to do the jobs that the 'real' heroes are either too busy or too 'good' to do. It's a crazy yet awesome plot and the cast is amazing. Nathan Fillion as T.D.K--his arms come off. Jai Courtney back as Boomerang--he throws... a boomerang. Flula Borg as Javelin--likewise, with a javelin. Mayling Ng as Mongal--she's an alien or something? Pete Davidson as Blackguard--who knows. And especially Sean Gunn as Weasel--a humanoid... weasel. And Michael Rooker as Savant--I'm not even sure, expert at throwing things? Him and Sean Gunn together was amusing coming off Guardians of the Galaxy. I'll admit I looked that one up; he's in everything! It's not at all the team of heroes you'd expect.

{{< spoiler >}}And then... they all die. Minor spoilers, but it's the first few minutes of the movie and none of those are top billing or on the posters.{{</ spoiler >}}

Not knowing that going in was a wonderful surprise and really fits with the whole theme of the movie. And after that, it only gets all the better, because we get introduced to the *real* Suicide Squad. And they're *even more ridiculous*.

Idris Elba as Bloodsport--he can use anything as a weapon; love him; criminally underused in the MCU. John Cena as Peacemaker--he can use anything as a weapon; yes, it's played up. David Dastmalchian as Polka-Dot Man--he can... spew dots? And has mother issues?

Yeah... it fits. Daniela Melchior as Ratcatcher 2; tech that controls rats. And KING SHARK--played by Sylvester Stallone.

I love it. It's an all star cast and the chemistry is hilariously bad at working together and planning...

> Bloodsport: What's the plan?

> Rick Flag: How the hell am I supposed to know?

> Peacemaker: You're the leader! You're supposed to be decisive!
> 
> Bloodsport: And I'm deciding that you should eat a big bag of dicks!
> 
> Peacemaker: If this whole beach was completely covered in dicks, and somebody said I had to eat every dick until the beach was clean for liberty, I would say "no problemo!"
> 
> Ratcatcher II: Why would someone put penises all over the beach?
> 
> Peacemaker: Who knows why madmen do what they do?

But you're going to root for them anyways. 

And then... there's Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. She's wonderfully bizarre and fits the movie perfectly--to the point that she really outshines all of the rest. I think the movie could honestly have had the movie with either less or more of her and been better. But she still gets some pretty spectacular scenes.

Overall... that was a good movie. Well worth the watch. Warning: It very much earns the R rating, both for language and for bloody violence. Up among in the top of my list for the year.
