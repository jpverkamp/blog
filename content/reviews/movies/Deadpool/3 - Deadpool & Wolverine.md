And so here it is, (almost) the entire reason I rewatched [[Deadpool]]() and [[Deadpool 2]](). 

In a nutshell, it's pretty much exactly what you get if you took the (crass) humor of Deadpool, jammed in as many cameos as you could, and shoved it into the modern [[Marvel Cinematic Universe|MCU]](), multiverse, TVA, and all...

> Deadpool: Welcome to the MCU. You're joining at a bit of a low point.

I'm still not *actually* sure if that's a good thing?

<!--more-->

On one hand, it's quite the spectacle. The scenes of Deadpool hopping from world to world, looking some Wolverine--any Wolverine--the replace his own world's was a lot of fun. The banter between Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman were a highlight of the film. 

> Kid 1: That's Deadpool.
> Kid 2: That's Wolverine.
> Deadpool: You damn straight it is. Fox killed him. Disney brought him back. They're gonna make him do this till he's 90.

Each time we saw yet another actor reprising a superhero role they hadn't played in years (decades in some cases) was another moment of delight. That feel reminded me a lot of [[Avengers: Endgame]]()... a payoff that really *shouldn't* have worked by itself, but built on all the films that came before became something truly special. Blade in particular? Wonderful!

Newcomers? Channing Tatum's Gambit was a delight. I'd love to see that move. And Emma Corrin as Cassandra Nova. Excellent villain.

> Deadpool: You're gonna send us home or I'm gonna twist your f*cking head off.    
> Cassandra Nova: [laughs]  
> Deadpool:  Why are you laughing?    
> Cassandra Nova: I can't send you unless you get this thing off my head. And as soon as you do that, I'm going to boil your brains on an atomic level whilst flicking my bean to the Enya box set.    
> Deadpool: There's an Enya box set?    

Humorwise, it's really mostly more of the same. The much broader selection of characters does give a chance for a lot more people to swear in amusing ways though, so there is that. 

Scenewise, the opening was ridiculous and spectacular. The whole Mad Max vibe of The Void was great, especially the Giant Man turned baddie base. And the Deadpool(s) showdown? Awesome. Looks like twice Deadpool 2's budget, which was almost twice the first Deadpool. 

> Wolverine: You stupid piece of shit. You just got him fucking killed!  
> Deadpool: Hey! We're all grieving!  
> Deadpool: P.S. Do you know what he was doing to the budget?  

But really, it didn't entirely feel like the first two Deadpool movies, which I found to be a bummer. More like the recent MCU movies, which... also a bummer. 

Overall, I enjoyed it! All three of them. But I'm also ready to watch something else now. 

Onward!
