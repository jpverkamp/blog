**language warning** (duh?)

Well that certainly started with a bang. 

After the surprsing (to some I suppose) success of [[Deadpool]](), of course they're going to make another. It's ... pretty much exactly what you'd expect if you took Deadpool and turned it up to, well, as far as Cable's gun goes. :smile:

We have more X-Men! Well, we have Yukio. And a delightful blink and you'll miss it group cameo. And Cable! He's from the X-Men comics at least?

> Cable: I use a device to slide through time. The longer I travel, the harder it is to control. I got two charges: one to get me here, one to get me home.
> 
> Wade Wilson: [looks at the camera] Well... that's just lazy writing.

We have the X-Force! A whole team building exercise... which goes about as well as you can expect. Another delightfully brief cameo there. Shocking, that one. The only longer term introduction of Domino was a lot of fun though. 

> Domino: They're headed into the tunnel.  
> Deadpool: I'm that kid's only hope, so sit tight and wait for my word.  
> Domino: Whatever. We're gonna lose 'em. I'm dropping in.  
> Deadpool: Uh, that's a negative, sole survivor. Luck is not a superpower! We are so fucked!  
> Deadpool: No, we are most certainly not fucked.  
> Deadpool: Seriously, I don't get it! What, you shoot luck lasers out your eyes? It's just hard to picture. And certainly not very cinematic. I mean, luck? What coked-out, glass pipe-sucking freakshow comic book artist came up with that little chestnut? Probably a guy who can't draw feet!  

There are some crazy action scenes (out of control transport truck!), although I think the giant falling container ship of the first one was still more impressive. 

I enjoyed it. 

Side note: Look up who voiced Juggernaut. I ... managed to completely miss that. 

> Deadpool: What do you get when you take 8-feet of chrome, one pinch of courage, a cup of good luck, a dab of racism, a splash of diabetes, and a wheelbarrow of stage 4 cancer? Answer: A family. See? I didn't lie what kind of film this was. If there's anything you take away today - other than the need to google "what the fuck is dubstep" - it's that we all need to belong to someone.
