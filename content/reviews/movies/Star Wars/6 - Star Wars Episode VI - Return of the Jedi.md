You know, that is a really solid movie. I know a lot of people prefer Empire, but for whatever reason, I've always liked Return of the Jedi more. That holds true even more, although I have to say that there are a few (possibly nostalgia fueled) particulars that I like more before the special editions changed things.

Things I loved: the whole intro sequence on Tatooine. Jabba is a perfectly disgusting villain without really being 'evil'. He's just purely in it for the greed, and that works great. I think it was better not to see him directly until now (unlike the new versions where's he's badly in A New Hope), but so it goes. Plus the Sarlacc battle is pretty awesome. Then we're back on Dagobah for a mystical moment, and the battle of Endor. The Ewoks... would have been better as Wookies and it really signals how incompetent the Empire is that they did as well as they did, but it's a big fun battle. And then on to the honking big space battle. Woo captial ship combat! And aliens actually playing part. 

Things I don't like: the crazy lip alien in Jabba's palace and the lack of Yub Nub...

...and Anakin's force ghost for some reason being so much younger. I guess that's when he 'died'? So that's the least of the bad things. All in the newer versions. Oh Lucas. A bit heavy handed there, yes?

Overall, still a solid movie and I'm glad to have watched it.

And now... on to the sequels. This should be interesting.
