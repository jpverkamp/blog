Not really sure what to say about this one. It's the Nativity story told from the point of view of various animals, voiced by a few famous people (Kris Kristofferson as 'Old Donkey' was pretty awesome... also Oprah apparently?). 

It's a cute enough story and the kids enjoy it. The songs are a nice touch. 

I expect this will be fairly low on my list for the year, mostly since I'm... not really the target audience. Conversely, I think it will be the movie I re-watch the most times this year. Interesting contrast.
