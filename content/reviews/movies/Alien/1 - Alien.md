It's been almost 50 years and it's impressively how well Alien hold ups. 

Don't get me wrong, the tech is a product of the time, looking impressively retrofuturistic, given the ways we've actually advanced since then. And the pacing is a bit slow and the jump scares not quite so scary in comparison to more modern scifi horror films. 

But there's a reason Alien is widely thought of as a progenitor of the scifi/horror genre. It's just a really good film. The effects and design hold up and Sigourney Weaver's Ripley is a powerhouse of a performance. 

A solid movie--and I've somehow managed to never watch *any* of the sequels. As they say, the second best time to do anything you've been meaning to do is *right now*. 

Onward!
