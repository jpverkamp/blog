That is a very pretty movie. The city had a great aesthetic. I loved the variety of cyborgs, many just trying to live their lives (in the background) or... becoming ridiculously overdone weapons platforms. And I especially loved Motorball!

Characterwise, Rosa Salazar as Alita really carried the show. I actually really enjoyed the oversized eyes (true to the manga apparently?) and her whole way of interacting with the world, the way she fights, the way she *moves*. It's a fascinating combination of innocence and excellence. 

Other than that... I wanted to like Christoph Walz's Dr. Ido more than I did--he's generally a wonderful actor, but I feel he just didn't have much to do. Likwise, Jennifer Connelly's Chiren. I did enjoy Mahershala Alis' Vector and most of the evil cyborgs. They did a good job of evil/menacing!

Plotwise? Straight forward. And the ending... really is asking for a sequel that so far as I know isn't coming. It'd be neat! But you can't just end a movie like that! Really leaves a poor taste on an otherwise quiet enjoyable movie. 

So it goes.

Onward!
