Man, time just keeps on going, doesn't it? 

Last year, I had reviewed 1300 books/170 movies/100 TV shows. 

This year? I'm up to 1418 book reviews, 187 movies, and 123 seasons. 

Jeeze. 

Overall this year:

* [Read 84 books](#books)
* [Watched 16 seasons of TV](#tv)
* [Watched 16 movies](#movies)
* [Played 251 different games a total of 1807 times -- 91 of them new to me](#board-games)
* [Played 38 games on steam (25 new) with 475 new achievements!](#steam-games)

## Books

Well. I didn't read [2023 Year in Reviews|298 books]()... or even [[2024 Year in Reviews|196]](). I know that 84 books is not at all shabby. But it just feels... less. 

In my defense though, I didn't read 100+ graphic novels from the [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]]() or all 50+ books of the [[Animorphs]]() series, which certainly helped those years. 

Next year, I hope to do better!

So what did I actually read? 

* 84 total books (~4.35 days/book; 88 pages/day)
  * 92% were new, only 7 were re-reads! I've probably got at least one big re-read coming up next year ([[The Dresden Files]]() has a new release, maybe two)
  * 17 standlones (20%) versus 67 in series; that's a fair bit higher, both of the last wo years I read only 13% standalones

* 35 unique authors
  * 26 by [[Kim Harrison]]() - All of [[The Hollows]](), which accounted for a large proportion of my audiobooks
  * 13 by [[Brandon Sanderson]]() - [[The Stormlight Archive]]() reread + Alcatraz for the first time
  * 7 by [[Ben Aaronovitch]]() - first time through the Rivers of London

* 5 books over 1000 pages (the Stormlight Archive)

My top months were February, March, and June with 11 books each. In November, I only read 2... :\

My top subgenre was easily Urban Fantasy (with both [[The Hollows]]() and [[Rivers of London]]()). I did have 20 labeled as science fiction and 12 mysteries though, which is fun. 

This year, I listened more than I read with 47 audiobooks, 34 ebooks, and 3 physical books. That's a first there, usually I do more ebooks (although again, comics and animorphs). 

Only 3 books I read this year were published before 2000, with none before 1990. So I should try for some older books. 

I did borrow 31 books (roughly 1/3) that I read from Libby, so a big shout out to them again!

## TV

Short version: I continued to (very slowly) re-watch Doctor Who, I started (somewhat more quickly) re-watching Lost with my wife, we tried Hacks (it was fine), and watched Severance (I loved it). 

In summary:

* I still love [[Doctor Who]]()
* [[Lost]]() holds up, although it's increasingly obvious as it goes on they didn't have an overarching plan
* [[Hacks: Season 1|Hacks]]() was not my sort of show
* [[A Man on the Inside]]() was so silly and fun--a lot like [[The Good Place]](), which makes sense given who it's from
* [[Agatha All Along]]() was good... but honestly would have been better if it wasn't in the MCU
* [[Arcane: Season 2]]() was insane. I'm honestly not sure if I liked season 1 better or not

## Movies

A decent enough mix. I did do Barbie/heimer to start the year off, followed by (re-)watching Indiana Jones, catching up a bit on the MCU, and starting the Alien franchies. Looking back, I need to finish all of that. 

Probably the stand out of the entire year? 

[[cover:KPop Demon Hunters]]()

It's just so catchy and doesn't overstay it's welcome. Quite the fun movie!

## Board Games

![Board game stats graphic](bg-stats.png)

Like I said, I played 251 games a total of 1807 times. Most were still on Board Game Arena, but I still did play 128 times / 67 games in person, which is always fun. 

### Overall

Overall, my H-index for this year was **21**! That means there are 21 games I played at least 21 times each. Among the top 5, we had:

* Welcome to the Moon - A flip and write with 8 surprisingly different maps/ways to play
* Forest Shuffle - Surprising depth for a card game with multiple roles per card and a fun theme
* Akropolis - Stacking tiles are always fun and this one has a surprising amount of depth in the scoring for not having variable scoring conditions
* Let's Go! To Japan - Everything is slightly random, which leads to a lot of variety; plus everyone plays at the same time
* Harmonies - A cute little puzzle game about placing cubes

But hey, I do have Terraforming Mars on that list (at #8 with 28 plays), so it's not all lighter games by any stretch. 

Some standouts among the new games this year:

* The White Castle - I'm still figuring this one out! For only 9 turns, a *lot* happens
* Pyramido - I ... did not realize this was new this year, I've played it 25 times already!
* Verdant - A houseplant placement game with a lot of scoring conditions
* Gnome Hollow - Making mushroom rings with tile placement
* Aquatica - A hand/tableau building underwater themed game 
* Aiye - Mancala, but more so;
* Zenith - A two player game about pushing on each of 5 planets/tracks, with several ways to play each card
* Apiary - Bees IN SPACE! Another Stonemeier hit
* Archiects of Amytis - Tic tac toe, but more so
* Railroad Tiles - Mentioned in my [in person](#in-person) section, Kickstarted and played a bunch of
* Parks (Second Edition) - I liked how the first edition did the variable track better, but it still fun to have on BGA again

### Two player games

I [played a bunch](#win-rate--player-count) of two player games this year, some designed for only that count, but many more flexible. My favorites (and most played) were:

* Forest Shuffle - You can pay a lot more attention to what the other player is doing; different strategies actually *work* with two players
* Welcome to the Moon - Mostly single player, but the missions are shared
* Harmonies - A drafting game, so you can see what the other player is doing; still a lot of luck
* Cartographers - Really it's a same time single player game (other than monsters)
* Zenith - Designed for two players
* Terraforming Mars - It can be more aggressive with two players and only sometimes faster
* Pyramido - Two players changes the drafting a bit; you have more strategry

### Win rate / player count

This year I won 33% of the games I played. 

| Player count | Games played | Win rate | Notes                         |
| ------------ | ------------ | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1            | 34           | 74%      |                               |
| 2            | 458          | 58%      | Most comment with family      |
| 3            | 851          | 27%      | My most common setting on BGA |
| 4            | 372          | 18%      |                               |
| 5            | 58           | 19%      |                               |
| 6            | 9            | 0%       | Ouch :smile:                  |
| 7            | 3            | 33%      |                               |

### In person

In person, my top games were: 

* My Island - A legacy/campaign style game, sequel to My City
* Railroad Tiles - A sequel of sorts to Railroad Ink; this time I caught the kickstarter!
* Sprawlopolis - Solo puzzle game
* Point City - In the Point Salad/Point Galaxy family; I think this is my favorite
* Marvel Champions: The Card Game

Overall, my H-index is only 4 though, so a lot more spread out. 

## Steam

![Steam stats graphic](steam-graphic.png)

Top games: 

* Revolution Idle - I got big into Idle games this year, with this being a major part of that--25% of my total play time, although I mostly just leave it up on another monitor--These are also *huge* for achievements, I got 274 of them this year (out of )
* Monster Train 2 - This one I actually played actively, so 17% of total play time is huge. 31% of achievements. It's Monster Train but *more better*, which I appreciate 
* [[Freshly (Frosted) Solved|Freshly Frosted]]() - A puzzle game that I solved back in January
* Noita - Still a major favorite with 10% of my playtime
* Snakecremental - Snake, but with a skill tree? I played a huge amount... in like 2 sessions. 

Best games for multiplayer:

* Stardew Valley - Obviously
* PlateUp! - It's a co-op cooking roguelite. What's not to love? (I wish it was a bit more tuned, but so it goes)
* MakeWay - It's a chaotic racing game where you build up the tracks as you go and everyone (constantly) explodes. What fun!

Best roguelites:

I still love the genre. With Noita (of course), Monster Train, but also Ball X Pit (so much fun for a while, but eventually slows down), and Hades II (I need to play more of this).

Programming games:

* Neon Noodles - A Zach-like game (but not by Zach) about making very very shiny sushi
* Replicube - What if graphics card, but 3D
* Kaizen - A new Zach-like (but not actually Zachtronics? for reasons), it's 
* Shenzen I/O - Old style Zachtronics, still great fun
 
Puzzle games:

* [[Freshly (Frosted) Solved|Freshly Frosted]]() - A conveyer belt game about frosting donuts
* Gentoo Rescue - A wonderful little puzzle game about penguins that I'm still part way through writing a solver for
