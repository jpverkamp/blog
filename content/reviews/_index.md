Years ago, when I was in grad school, I had something of a flexible schedule. I took advantage of that to go see a movie in theaters every week or two. Sounds crazy in the times of COVID-19, but I enjoyed it. My goal then was to arrange the movies I saw in a year into a ranking (unique to that year). More recently, I decided to start watching and reviewing movies again, albeit this time without the theaters...

Also... I read a ridiculous amount. Hundreds of books a year. A few years ago, I decided to start reviewing everything I read. Several hundred posts later... here we are. :)
