It started more than a decade ago now ([2012!](/reviews/lists/2012-movie-reviews/)). I was catching up to 30 new releases in a year in theaters and reviewing them. Then at some point ([2014](/lists/2014-movie-reviews/)), life happened[^kid] and I didn't make it to the theater as much anymore. 

[^kid]: My oldest was born in 2014. A coincidence I'm sure. 

After that, [starting in 2015](/reviews/lists/2015-book-reviews/), I realized I could do the same thing with books! And I started writing a review of every book I read. And I read a lot. Since then, I've reviewed over 1300 books--and I still have over 1000 on my to read list. So that isn't likely to stop any time soon. 

It's mostly fantasy and to a lesser extent scifi, although I do get a few horror novels in there, along with a couple non-fiction or poetry anthologies a year. I'm always looking for more to add though. Hit me up!

Then, starting in 2021, I started again with the [movie reviews](/reviews/lists/2021-movie-reviews/), this time mostly ignoring what was in theaters, instead watching whatever seemed interesting, much like my book reviews. And this time, I added [TV reviews](/reviews/lists/2021-tv-reviews/) as well. 

And... here we are. Really, it's as much a memory aid for me as anything. I love being able to look back at all the covers I read in a year, pick one at random, and use my own writing to remind me of a particular book/movie/show. And if anyone else is inspired to read something out of it? Well, all the better!
