Apparently I got myself off on the last two chapters of A Sea of Stars. Everything should be fixed now, but if you've been following along, you may want to check that you've read the correct chapters. The two most recent chapters should be:

* [Chapter 9: Lies]({{< ref "2012-09-25-a-sea-of-stars-ch-9-lies.md" >}})
* Chapter 8: Counterpoint

Now I know to be a little more careful in double checking everything I post. :smile:
