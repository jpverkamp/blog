This time around my goal was 2500 words per day.

I hit it more days than not, although I had a few days where I wrote little or even (twice) nothing. I had two great days, one of which was today, which pushed me over 50k. I'm also nowhere near the end of this book (I wouldn't be surprised if I cut close to half of what I've written thus far). It's certainly been an interesting journey.
