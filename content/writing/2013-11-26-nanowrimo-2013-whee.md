Five days ahead of time and I've just finished my 50,000 words for the month!

<!--more-->

So does that mean I'm done? Of course not. I've finished first drafts of 3 novels and have two more mostly complete and never have I come in at under 100,000. This looks to be much the same. So I have a bit more to go.Â Still, I think I'm going to cut back a bit. To finish early, I've been writing 2,000 words a day, but between life, a job, and my PhD research, writing that much is a bit of a strain. Luckily though, I have a bit of a backlog of chapters, so I should easily be able to keep posting at least two chapters a week.

That being said, if anyone has any comments on what I've posted thus far, I'd love to hear it (either as a comment, <a href="https://twitter.com/@jpverkamp">on Twitter</a>, or <a href="mailto:me@jverkamp.com">email me</a>). I know the grammar is a bit rough, but I'm personally enjoying where the story is going. I'm starting to get a fairly clear idea of a potential ending as well; we'll see how that goes. :smile:
