I'm still doing it! Just not posting as much about it. 

This time around, I'm writing sci-fi/cosmic horror, roughly based on a half remembered book I last read more then 15 years ago. Good times, no? Once this is all said and done, I'm going to have to go back and take a look to see how far I diverged.

For the first time (I think), I wrote a consistent 2000 words every day. And only twice did I finish after midnight (sleep is important yo)!

The two bumps are when I finished after midnight, and although I finished well before midnight today, I didn't actually get around to updating the word count online. Too busy celebrating and all that. :D

Anyways, there's still a long way to go to figure out where this novels ends. I've got a good feeling about it though.
