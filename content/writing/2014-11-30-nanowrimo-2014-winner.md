Just under the wire this year.

It took a bit to get going, given that I basically restarted on Day 7:

{{< figure src="/embeds/2014/2014-Progress-NaNoWriMo.png" >}}

Basically, I wrote 3000 words each of the first three days and then settled in for 2000 words a day after that. I had one day where I just couldn't make it past 1000. So it goes.

As far as overall progress goes, I'm most of the way through chapter 10 of a planned 19 (there's something to be said for outlining ahead of time after all...), so I should be done around Christmas.

Onwards and upwards!
