...must eventually come to an end.

Well, at least I hope that this qualifies as a good thing. It's the end either way. :smile:

I also hope that you've enjoyed reading this as much as I've enjoyed writing it over these past two and a half months. The entire story started as two ideas in my notebook (*'confession of a suicide'* and *'Cup of Lazarus'*) and sort of grew from there. It's a fascinating way of writing, never knowing exactly how everything is going to come together. I think it actually worked out pretty well this time around though and there weren't *too* many loose ends left dangling. ;)

Knowing that there were people out there reading it each morning pushed me to get something--anything--out each day. I only missed one day, keeping up an average of 1,455 words per day. Slightly below the NaNoWriMo target, but none too shabby either. For anyone that's curious, I'm a bit of a statistics / coding geek, so I actually wrote a script to keep track of the chapters as I wrote them. Here are the final counts:


|    Place    | Count | Words  | Avg/Section |
|-------------|-------|--------|-------------|
| al-Eizariya |  10   |  6400  |   640.00    |
|   Baghdad   |  48   | 31229  |   650.60    |
|   Chicago   |  57   | 37786  |   662.91    |
|    Rome     |  48   | 32288  |   672.67    |
|   Overall   |  163  | 107703 |   660.75    |


I think that I've learned a lot over the course of writing this, although there's always more to learn. With time for one final confession of my own, I guess I should mention that I'm not actually Catholic. I was born into a mostly Catholic extended family and raised in an almost entirely Catholic region of Southern Indiana, but it's just not for me. My fiance is Catholic though and helped shoot down some of the crazier ideas that I went through as I was writing. There are still a few things on her list of *things that a priest just wouldn't do* that I intend to fix though, so if you have anything else, I'd love to hear it.

Speaking of which, if anyone has any feedback or constructive criticism, send it in! Feel free to either leave a comment or to send me an email (<a href="mailto:me@jverkamp.com">me@jverkamp.com</a>). I hope to go through and edit / tighten this up (some parts really need it :smile:) and perhaps self-publish on Amazon / other ebook markets. We'll see how that goes.

So far as what comes next? I'm not sure yet. I'm going to take a week or two off from posting writing related content to get caught back up on other parts of my life, but I'll be back. I don't intend to ever stop writing.
