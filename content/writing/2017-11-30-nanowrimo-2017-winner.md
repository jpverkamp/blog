Well. I made it.

Had one of my best NaNoWriMos ever [last year]({{< ref "2016-11-30-nanowrimo-2016-winner.md" >}}). This was not that. It took me forever to get started. About halfway through the month, I finally found my muse and had a series of 5000 word days in a row, but slacked off again. Had to finish the month with 10k words in two days. I can do it. Doesn't mean it's a good idea.

The story is pretty neat. Beauty and the Beast appeared somehow. Always fun writing by the seat of your pants.

Still going to do it next year I bet.
