[Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/) is an absolute masterpiece of a game. It's perfect for a brian like main that loves to build things up, solve problems, and make things work. Perhaps too perfect. To date, I've put almost 2000 hours into the game over a number of runs, getting more complicated each time. Most recently, I've started a heavily modded run based around Space Exploration (adds planets!), Krastorio2 (designed to work with SE, think of it as Factorio++), LTN (automatic trains), Rampant (better enemies, although disabled on Nauvis), and the entire Brevven suite of a half dozen additional materials. If you'd like a full list of mods, I've included one [at the end of this post](#mods).

It should be fun. :smile:

I figured this time around, I should actually post my progress. Probably not straight up videos, although that's a possibility at some point, but rather screenshots and perhaps a few short clips. If you're interested, take a look, drop me a line. I'd love to chat about it. If not, just skip over it. This is as much for me (supplemental memory go!) as anything. :smile:

It's it just so much fun to watch?

Onward!

## The map

As always, we start in the middle of the map, a bit to the East (in this case) of our starting lake. You can already see here that we've tapped all sorts of starting resources. 

![The map after 7 hours](map.png)

## The burner phase

First, the crash landing. For a while here, all I had was a series of burner mines on each ore type (as seen below). During the early game with Brevven's mods, you eat up iron as normal, but also a ton of aluminum, and also zircon (for anything that would otherwise need stone). In addition to the manual burner miners, I had a series of three furnaces for each ore. The second and third rows here are both for aluminum, it's a two step process. More on that later. 

![My original base with an example 4 burner mining setup and random furnaces](crash-landing.png)

One thing that you can already see here was that I'm going for a combination of spaghetti (there will be belts going everywhere until I get to trains) and roads (so I always have somewhere to walk). We'll see how that goes. 

## Basic and Automation (Red) Tech Cards

### First smelting arrays

So at first, everything was manual. But of course, that can't last. The factory must grow. 

The first resources on the block? Aluminum and iron of course!

If you look back at the [map](#the-map), aluminum is the tan color right by the lake. Right in the middle of everything. That made for an interesting first build, I was already taking that space. 

![Very first smelting array: aluminum](aluminum.png)

Especially since it needs multiple steps. Eventually I made a larger smelting array for aluminum to the south. 

![Second aluminum smelter, more throughput](aluminum2.png)

Not big, but enough for the moment. That goes all of the base... it's such a wonderful  mess. 


Each array is designed with a pattern I've seen and used a number of times with two splitters facing each other, one for coal and one for the resource to smelt. That way they can be chained side to side. In this case, the output is the same direction as the input:

![Example of a smelting array](smelters.png)

Next up, iron. The main patch of that is to the far southeast of the [map](#the-map), so I had to run a belt up a decent bit to a smelting array. I thought about doing it on-site, but at this point in the game there's not much difference.

![Iron patch set up, a bit more belt for this one](iron.png)

Whew. That's a lot and we still only have two resources. :smile:

### Science

Aluminum and iron are enough to set up the basic tech cards (science packs in Krastorio). I no longer have my original hand fed science setup, but here's what I have built for basic, automation (red), and logistic (green):

![Science setup, building basic and automation on site and importing logistic](science.png)

Everything has already been upgraded to electric assemblers and inserters, but I'm still using those burner labs so have to bring in coal for that. Luckily, you can snake the coal in pretty well. Originally, everything was hand fed, but now I have belts snaking all through bringing resources in from other parts of the base. For basic tech, aluminum and wood. For automation, iron as well. I'll come back to logistic. 

### Early manufacturing

Two things that I need a ton of that I can automate: belts (of various kinds) and inserters (only yellow, since I'm using Bob's inserters):

![Factories for belts and inserters;l slow, but steady](belts-and-inserters.png)

They're not at all fast, but they build up enough over time for the time being. 

Man I have such a mess of belts running around those. :smile: Isn't it wonderful? 

### Power

So far, we're really basic on power. I just have a fuel processor running on coal (it adds 10%) and a handful of burner turbines. I'll probably upgrade to steam soon.

![Simple early power setup](power.png)

Although, I could use my natural gas setup...

## Logistic (Green) Tech Cards

### Greenhouses

I never understood quite why you couldn't automate wood in the base game. No worries, with Krastorio, you can!

![My greenhouses, providing a slow but steady flow of wood](greenhouses.png)

It's not much, but it's more than enough for right now. 

This is one interesting bit that Brevven's mods brought to the table: to make pipes, I needed lead (I'll come back to that). But to make *underground* pipes, you need solder, which needs tin as well, and a foundry. So... all above ground pipes for now! I really like that wrinkle. A bit more thinking. :smile:

So that's enough for tech 1 and 2. Back to more resources. 

### Stoneworks

Other than aluminum and iron, I've also tapped a number of other basic resources. I have stone in the south and zircon in the west coming around the bottom of my lake to make a stoneworks. 

![A stoneworks that can make stone, bricks, sand, and glass](stoneworks.png)

By far the most interesting bit is that glass needs alumina (a byproduct of making aluminum) and tin (which you get back 80% of the time). So far, the prioritization loops I have in place are working well enough, but I imagine logistics for that are only going to get more interesting. 

![The recipe for glass](glass.png)

### Other metals

We also have tin in the west, copper in the northwest, and lead in the northeast. For the most part, basic smelting setups, except lead produces copper ore as a byproduct. Again, I prioritize things that are byproducts over direct production to not bottleneck anything. It's worked so far. 

![Smelters for lead and copper](lead-and-copper.png)

### Natural gas and early plastic

Speaking of which, one of the Brevven resources is natural gas. You can tap it early, but at first, all you can do is burn it for power. I don't have tanks or even underground pipes yet after all...

![Pumping and splitting natural gas](natural-gas.png)

But finally I've gotten to the point of making it into [[wiki:formaldehyde]](), which in turn can be made into a very early plastic: [[wiki:bakelite]](). Oh factorio, making me learn things about real chemistry. 

![Making basic plastic](early-plastic.png)

### More metals: bronze and solder

Finally, we're getting somewhere. With all the basic metals, we can combine them in the foundry (from Brevven as well) to make bronze and solder:

![Foundries making bronze and solder](bronze-and-solder.png)

They're so fast compared to the scale I'm at that I only need a handful, but with those and copper, I have enough to make green circuits already!

### Logistics Tech Cards

And... green tech cards! (Logistic)

![Simple green tech cards](green-tech.png)

## What's next? 

And that's all. 7 hours. That's quite a lot, but I'm loving it so far.

As always, the next tech card is the next goal, but with green science comes a number of other cool things I hope to do this week:

- Trains / LTN: At least a basic network, possibly full blown train stations.
- AAI Wardens: Construction on wheels, albeit without bots so far.
- Early oil processing: Mostly for the next tech cards.
- Chemical Tech (Blue): Unlocks bots!
- Early core mining: All the resources! I don't know if I'm ready for that, especially power wise. 

Onward!
