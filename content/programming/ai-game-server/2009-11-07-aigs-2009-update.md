New version uploaded.

Bug fixes:

* Fixed swapping players bug.
* Potential fix for not your turn bug (not sure if this one will work).
* Sending 'Unsolvable' as a move can be used to prematurely end a game (and will output the game log).
* Fixed/removed extra YourTurn packets sent on failed move.
* Fixed capturing, players can now capture correctly and wil respawn at their bases.
* Fixed returning flags. Flags were returning at (0, 0), now the return to their spawn points.
* End of game now actually ends instead of looping with a winner (or Tie Game) returned.
* Removed extra print statements from server code (that were printing multiple slightly different states).
