Updated with almost everything necessary to play the tournament.  I still need to implement the game timer per side.  I will have the up before AI class meets Monday.

All of the changes that are mentioned in the Tournament Rules document have been completed with the following notes:

* Always 3 players per team
* Not guaranteed to be solvable (though I haven't seen an unsolvable one yet).
* You can only capture flags on the other side of the board
* Flags respawn at random locations on your side of the map
* You can only see your flags when they have not been captured
* Non-wall squares you cannot see will be sent as a '*'
* Captured players will spawn adjacent to their home base
* If no location is available, they will try further out in concentric circles


<!--more-->

Behavior of respawning flags:

* If the original location is occupied by a player that can pick up the flag, they will immediately.
* If the original location is occupied by a player that can not pick up the flag (wrong team or already holding a flag), the flag will spawn in a nearby available square.
* This may change in class today, if so the server will be updated to match the requirements in class.

Also, the timer has been implemented.  Once you have used your 3 minutes, the server will not ask you to take another turn

Finally, changes from today's class:

* Enable random seeds for tournaments (0 to use time)
* Add flag spawn points
* Players can move onto enemy spawns
* Players cannot move onto their own spawns
* Flag carrying players cannot move onto spawns.
* Bases and flag spawns have vision of eight adjacent
* Players have Manhattan vision of 4 (as opposed to old vision algorithm)
* Display fog of war with non-constant players
* Add board state to YourTurn
* Add remaining time messages

New packets of interest:

CreateTournament <seed>

* Creates a new tournament map with the given seed.
* Use 0 to use the server's system time as a seed.

SetConstantPlayer

* For the server to always treat you as player 0.
* Will flip the board so that you are on the left.

RequestScores

* Should return each teams current score.
* Your teams score should be first followed by your opponents
