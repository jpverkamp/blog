This is the first version of both the AI Game Server documentation and code. To write a client for the AIGS, I would suggest reading the documentation, it should contain all you need to connect to and interact with the server.

If you run the included jar file, it will run a working copy of the server. This version of the server does not contain a complete GUI, I hope to have that in a few days; however, a working version of Hex is included. If you would like to see the source cope, just open the jar file, all of the source code is included.

**Changes in this version:**

* Added second player swap rule.
* Added 4th argument to JoinSuccess to show which player the client is.
* Added 4th argument to GameState to show which player the client is.
* Moved test clients Hex_Random and Hex_LineMan into the AIGS project.

** Likely improvements in the next release:**

* Fix JTree large box bug.
* Add ability to spawn test clients.
* Add menu (mainly for above ability and about box).
