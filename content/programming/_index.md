title: "Programming"
---
The earliest memory I have of 'programming' is in the early/mid 90s when my father brought home a computer from work. We could play games on it ... so of course I took the spreadsheet program he used (LOTUS 123, did I date myself with that?) and tried to modify it to print out a helpful message for him. It ... halfway worked? At least I could undo it so he could get back to work...

After that, I picked up programming for real in QBASIC (I still have a few of those programs lying around), got my own (junky) Linux desktop from my cousin, tried to learn VBasic (without a Windows machine), and eventually made it to high school... In college, I studied computer science and mathematics, mostly programming in Java/.NET, although with a bit of everything in the mix. A few of my oldest programming posts on this blog are from that time.

After that, on to grad school! Originally, I was going to study computational linguistics, but that fell through. Then programming languages (the school's specialty). And finally I ended up studying censorship and computer security. That's about where I am today!

But really, I still have a habit of doing [a little bit of everything](/programming/topics/). Whatever seems interesting at the time!
