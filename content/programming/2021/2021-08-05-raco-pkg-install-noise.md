What feels like a million years and a lifetime ago, I wrote up a [library for perlin and simple noise in Racket]({{< ref "2013-04-11-perlin-and-simplex-noise-in-racket" >}}). Inspired by [Jens Axel SÃ¸gaard's new Sketching library](https://github.com/soegaard/sketching) (processing in Racket) and a conversation thereabout, I figure it's about time to push noise to the `raco` package manager!

It's alive!

I still have to figure out how to get it to see the documentation, but that's pretty cool. I should really get back into Racket. It's a fun language for a lot of things.
