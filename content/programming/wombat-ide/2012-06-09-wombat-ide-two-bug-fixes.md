Two quick bug fixes:

* [Issue 196](https://code.google.com/p/wombat-ide/issues/detail?id=196 "Issue 196"): color-set! now works correctly (previously it wouldn't actually mutate the color object)
* [Issue 197](https://code.google.com/p/wombat-ide/issues/detail?id=197 "Issue 197"): Automatically determine the correct semester for the upload button
