Bug fixes:

* Added the ability to cancel when saving on close
* Fixed Stop with Petite
* Fixed an issue where the cursor wouldn't be at the end on up arrow
* Updated the launcher to actually exit in all cases, including errors on startup
* Fixed build process for Petite sub-directories
* Altered the Launcher to download zip archives and unzip them rather than grabbing the executable directly
* Set the executable bit on unpacking files from zip so that Petite actually works on Linux and OSX machines
