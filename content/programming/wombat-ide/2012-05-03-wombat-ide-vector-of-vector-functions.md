Added two functions to the <a title="C211 Matrix API" href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/cgi-pub/c211/wombat/docs/c211-matrix.htm">matrix library</a>:

* `(vov->matrix vov)` - converts a vector of vectors to a matrix
* `(matrix->vov m)` - converts a matrix to a vector of vectors

Quick and simple, but highly useful for testing and display purposes.
