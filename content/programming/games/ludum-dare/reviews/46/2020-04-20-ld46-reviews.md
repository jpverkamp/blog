As part of [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/), you're supposed to review games. Here are some of my favorites (in the order I reveiwed them, so no particular order).

# Rolly and the Flower

It's an adorable little platformer where you're a robot carrying a flower. You have to keep it alive. That's about all there is to it, but it has nice music, fun sound effects, and it's a lot of fun. Man the levels with guns are frustrating.

# Nemysis

Top down tower defense with retro graphics and awesome music. It's a bit slow, but you can really build up some nice defenses.

# Vital signs

{{< figure src="/embeds/2020/ld46-review-vital-signs.png" >}}

A multitasking rhythmesqe game. You start having to control the body temperature with E/R, then add a heartbeat with SPACE, and finally (as far as I got) breathing as well with UP/DOWN. Man it's hard to do it all at once.

The graphics and audio are top notch.

# Supernova

Try to fling radioactive rocks into the sun to buy humanity enough time to escape. Neat concept and the music is wonderful. The controls are more than a tad sluggish and I wish you could have done something more with gavity/orbiting.

Reminds me of [Osmos](https://www.osmos-game.com/)

# That Time I Crossed A Barren Desert To Protect & Care The World From Terrible Code

Keep **IT** alive. Excellent.

Also, I love the tutorial style:

Needed the VisualC++ runtime


# Keep the beat alive

A fun little rhythm/bullet hell game. I love the music. I should look more into Pico.

# Batteries Included

I swear I've seen this game before. It's a platformerer where you're a battery. If you touch various objects, you power them up. Some move, some kill you. It's a lot of fun. Great music too.

# Haiku, and the Mother Virus

It's basically a more polished [Super Crate Box](http://supercratebox.com/), which is impressive for 48 hours... Platform around on a small level with ever spawning guns and baddies. The music is intense and I think it's responding to which gun I have? That's cool.

# Feed

Katamari Damacy as a platformer! Fun. The controls need some work, but I played it longer than most games I've been reviewing.
