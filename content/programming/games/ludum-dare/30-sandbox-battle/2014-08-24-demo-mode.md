Quick update this morning: I managed to get a 'demo mode' working. Now when you first start the game, the boxes will be whizzing around in the background giving you an idea of what you're about to get yourself into!

As soon as you start, you'll go right back to the normal mode. Between rounds, there's no demo, since it's still showing the last round's game.

Unfortunately, it doesn't stop, so if you just let it sit for a while, strange things may happen:

Also, instructions (technically, these were in last night, but I don't think I mentioned them):

Current demo:
