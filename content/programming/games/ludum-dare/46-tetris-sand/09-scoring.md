I am really really proud of this year, especially the 17<sup>th</sup> place finish in Innovation. I thought the idea was fairly unique, but I never considered it might be just *that* unique. 

Overall, I had a lot of fun! I look forward to the next time around, although it falls Oct 2-5 which is the time of year where a whole pile of family birthdays fall. We'll still try!
