Here's another day's work on ChessLike. It's actually a bit less full featured than yesterday, but I've made a lot of progress towards the dungeon framework that I'm going for.

<!--more-->

Things that work:

* Level generation for the first two tiers of levels and the first tier of special levels
* Descending stairways connecting different levels
* Possible bonus stairways to reach special levels
* Loss condition (you have to keep your King alive)

Things that don't work yet:

* Third, fourth, and fifth tier levels; the second tier of special levels
* {{< wikipedia "Fairy chess pieces" >}}: Grasshopper, Squirrel, Archbishop, Marshall, Unicorn
* Bonus for capture all enemy pieces on a level (rather than just running for the stairs)
* Win condition


One day left! I can do this.
