One more update on my quick schedule than it's back to school so I'll probably slow down for a while.  In any case, I've added the ability to change between different elements in the definitions files.

Two new changes to the definitions are the addition of placeability and colorful flags.  If placeability is set, the element will show up on the GUI to be placed.  If colorful is set, the colors will be varied slightly (see the screenshots).

Next up, seeing if I can come up with more elements to play with...

**Screenshots:**

The basic screen isn't much different than the last version.  The main changes are the borders and extra space and the toolbar on the right that can be used to choose which element to place.  The X shows the currently selected element.****

With the re-addition of walls, it's easier than ever to create a bucket.  You can see the color variability in the water.  The wall doesn't have the colorful variable set, so it appears as a flat gray.****

The plants look even more interesting with the color variability.****

A still screen shot doesn't convey the full sense of the how awesome the fire looks in this version.  As the fire spread, sparks shoot off and a cloud of smoke rises to the top of the screen.  I highly recommended you try it out.**
