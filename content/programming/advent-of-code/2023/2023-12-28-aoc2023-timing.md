A quick follow up to [[Advent of Code 2023]](): testing and timing. 

It's been bothering me a bit that I haven't had a generic way to run tests and timing on every problem as I'm going. 

So let's fix it!

{{<toc>}}

## Testing

I've been filling out test data with a theoretical future macro like this:

```rust
// #[aoc_test("data/test/01.txt", 142)]
// #[aoc_test("data/test/01b.txt", 209)]
// #[aoc_test("data/01.txt", 53651)]
```

Which *almost* works (and would be fine if we were using a procedural macro). But if we want to use a more simple declarative macro with `macro_rules!` instead, we have to deal with [[wiki:macro hygiene]](). Basically, we can't create new names (which we'd love to do for the module names).

So instead, I ended up with this:

```rust
aoc_test::generate!{day01_part1_test_01 as "test/01.txt" => "142"}
aoc_test::generate!{day01_part1_test_01b as "test/01b.txt" => "209"}
aoc_test::generate!{day01_part1_01 as "01.txt" => "53651"}
```

A bit longer than I'd like, but workable. And with a bit of regex (and a script to actually get the package and binary name), we can automatically rewrite the old form to this. 

The actual macro:

```rust
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! generate {
    ($name:tt as $input_file:tt => $expected:tt) => {
        #[cfg(test)]
        mod $name {
            use super::*;
            use std::fs::OpenOptions;
            use std::io::prelude::*;

            #[test]
            fn run_test() {
                let filename = format!("../../data/{}", $input_file);
                let input = std::fs::read_to_string(filename).unwrap();
                let actual = process(input.as_str()).unwrap();

                assert_eq!(actual, $expected);
            }
        }
    };
}
```

That's really it! Running it with `cargo test` we get a *giant* pile of output. [`cargo nextest`](https://nexte.st/) does much better:

```bash
$ cargo nextest run --release

## Timing

And then come to think of it... this would actually be a perfect place to put some timing in as well!

```rust
#[test]
fn run_test() {
    let filename = format!("../../data/{}", $input_file);
    let input = std::fs::read_to_string(filename).unwrap();

    let start = std::time::Instant::now();
    let actual = process(input.as_str()).unwrap();
    let elapsed = start.elapsed();

    if std::env::var("AOC_TIMING").is_ok() {
        let output = format!(
            "{},{},{},{:?},{}",
            stringify!($name),
            $expected,
            actual,
            elapsed,
            elapsed.as_nanos()
        );

        let mut file = OpenOptions::new()
            .create(true)
            .append(true)
            .open("../timing.csv")
            .unwrap();
        writeln!(file, "{}", output).unwrap();
    }

    assert_eq!(actual, $expected);
}
```

That will write out a single `csv` with all of the test output, with the `$name`, `$expected` and `actual` value, and timing (both human readable and straight nanoseconds). 

A bit of formatting--including  dropping all of the test cases and alternate versions and adding line counts--and we have:

My unwritten rule is to write roughly ~100 lines (although I'm far more flexible on this one) and spend less than 1 second on each problem. I only had 3 part 2s over 1 second and even those weren't bad. 

I'm honestly not sure how to improve collisionator if that's even the time with [the Z3 theorem prover...](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3). I suppose optimize what constraints I'm giving it? Sometimes solutions just take time!

Linewise, I'm fairly happy. Lines of code are a fairly terrible metric, but it's at least a very vague signal? I did get over the mark (more than) a few times. My longest (counting everything) was 383 lines for day 19, part 2. 

Actually, only 9 parts are under 100 lines (including imports, whitespace, and comments). But you know... I'm okay with that to!

## Summary

Overall, it was an interesting year. I miss the programming problem we've had in previous years (like [[AoC 2016 Day 23: Assembunny2|2016's Assembunny]]() and 2015's days [[Advent of Code: Day 7|day 7]]() and [[Advent of Code: Day 23|day 23]]()). 

I'm not a huge fan of problems that reliy on cycle detection (a big favorite this year: [[AoC 2023 Day 8: Mazinator|day 8]](), [[AoC 2023 Day 14: Spininator|day 14]](), [[AoC 2023 Day 20: Flip-Flopinator|day 20]](), [[AoC 2023 Day 21: Step Step Stepinator|day 21]]()), especially when it's only guaranteed to work based on problem input. 

I'm a bit sad that we only got a few animations in this year:

[[AoC 2023 Day 14: Spininator]]()

<video controls src="/embeds/2023/aoc23-14-direction.mp4"></video>

[[AoC 2023 Day 16: Reflectinator]]()

<video controls src="/embeds/2023/aoc23-16.mp4"></video>

My overall favorites this year:

* [[AoC 2023 Day 7: Pokinator]]() - Implementing a custom `Ord` was neat. 
* [[AoC 2023 Day 12: Question Markinator]]() - An example of how powerful caching/[[wiki:dynamic programming]]() can be.
* [[AoC 2023 Day 16: Reflectinator]]() - Lasers! And an animation.
* [[AoC 2023 Day 19: Assembly Lininator]]() - I guess this does count as a virtual machine? I actually like the 'apply to a range' problems.
* [[AoC 2023 Day 20: Flip-Flopinator]]() - Circuit simulations are pretty cool and *almost* a virtual machine!
* [[AoC 2023 Day 24: Collisionator]]() - I actually enjoyed the brute force solution to that one (after trying with the solver).

Another fun year and I think I'm getting better at Rust! If you think I'm totally making that up / have any useful advice, I'd love to hear it though.

And now, time to get back to everything I drop in December to work on these problems. :smile:

Onward!
