Another year, another [[Advent of Code]](). 

Like last year, we're doing Rust. I've really grown to love the language since last year... and hopefully I've learned a bit more about how to write more 'proper' Rust. I know I had some issues last year. Functional... but it could be better.

Let's see how it goes!

For full solutions, as always, I post to GitHub (including previous years and possibly some I haven't written up yet): <a href="https://github.com/jpverkamp/advent-of-code">jpverkamp/advent-of-code</a>

Here's a full list of all of the posts:

At least at first, I'm going to be using the same helper lib and template that I had [last year]({{<ref "2022-12-01-advent-of-code-2022.md">}}), with a few changes:

* `part1` and `part2` are returning [`anyhow`](https://docs.rs/anyhow/latest/anyhow/) `Result<String>`; this will allow us to use the `?` operator
* I cleaned up a few suggestions that `cargo clippy` suggested
* The built in tests are testing both `data/test/__.txt` (the given small test case) and my full data

That's really about it though. I'd like to switch over to a workspace and properly extract some shared code into modules or dig more deeply into benchmarking, but we'll see if I get there. 

Onward!

And here are my previous year's solutions:
