## Part 1

> Let a Snafu number be a base 5 number with the curious property that in addition to the digits 0, 1, and 2, it has the numbers `-` as `-1` and `=` as `-2`. Sum up a list of Snafu numbers. 

<!--more-->

:blink: Sure!

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
struct Snafu {
    value: String,
}

impl Display for Snafu {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut std::fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> std::fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "{}", self.value)
    }
}

impl From<String> for Snafu {
    fn from(value: String) -> Self {
        Snafu { value }
    }
}

impl From<isize> for Snafu {
    fn from(mut v: isize) -> Self {
        // Convert to base 5
        let mut digits = Vec::new();

        while v > 0 {
            let m = v % 5;
            v = v / 5;

            if m < 3 {
                digits.push(m.to_string());
            } else if m == 3 {
                digits.push(String::from("="));
                v += 1;
            } else if m == 4 {
                digits.push(String::from("-"));
                v += 1;
            }
        }

        Snafu {
            value: digits.into_iter().rev().collect::<Vec<_>>().join(""),
        }
    }
}

impl Into<isize> for Snafu {
    fn into(self) -> isize {
        self.value.chars().fold(0, |a, c| match c {
            '2' | '1' | '0' => a * 5 + c.to_digit(10).unwrap() as isize,
            '-' => a * 5 - 1,
            '=' => a * 5 - 2,
            _ => panic!("Snafu SNAFUed, what the Snafu is a {c}"),
        })
    }
}
```

The main complication is that when you're doing the normal base conversion, if you ever see a `3` or `4`, you instead need to 'borrow' one from the next round (thus the `v += 1`) and write up `=` or `-` instead. Other than that, pretty standard stuff. 

To sum them:

```rust
fn part1(filename: &Path) -> String {
    Snafu::from(
        iter_lines(filename)
            .map(Snafu::from)
            .map::<isize, _>(Snafu::into)
            .sum::<isize>(),
    )
    .to_string()
}
```

Elegant. It's interesting that I can specify the `B` type on `Map<B, F>` to let `rustc` know that `Snafu::into` is making a `Snafu` `From` an `isize`. I just wish I knw the syntax for chaining the `Shafu::from` on the end instead. But it's all good. 

## Performance

```bash
./target/release/25-snafuinator 1 data/25.txt

2-10==12-122-=1-1-22
took 504Âµs
```

Yeah. :smile:

## Full timing

As always, no part 2. So here is my full timing (using the test suite) for the year:

That's a pretty awesome amount of 0.00s (16 of the 25 days). :smile:

The only ones over 1 second:

* Day 16 Pressurinator: 12.56s
* Day 17 Tetrisinator: 1.39s
* Day 19 Blueprintinator: <strike>2m20.19s</strike> [1.92s]({{<ref "#edit-dec-25-evening-">}})
* Day 23 Elf Scattinator: 8.23s
* Day 24 Blizzinator: 2.75s

With the exception of Day 19, keeping them around or under 10 seconds isn't bad at all. I may have to take another crack at optimizing that one. 

Some day. :smile:

Until then, Merry Christmas!

## Edit Dec 25 (evening :smile:)

Perhaps some day can even be today! See [my edit to Day 19]({{<ref "2022-12-19-blueprintinator#edit-dec-25-optimizing-max-builds" >}}). Sooo much faster.

$ cargo test --release --bin 19-blueprintinator
