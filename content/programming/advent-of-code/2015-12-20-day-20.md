**Part 1:** *P(n)* is defined such that for each number *i*, add *10i* to any number divisible by *i*. Find the first value *n* such that *P(n)* is at least a given target number.

<!--more-->

Let's throw some memory (and <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">numpy</a>) at it:

```python
target = int(sys.argv[1])

presents = numpy.zeros(target)

for i in range(1, target):
    presents[i::i] += 10 * i

for i in range(len(presents)):
    if presents[i] >= target:
        print(i)
        sys.exit(0)
```

It barely makes it in under a minute, but it does. You can speed it up even more if you guess on where the answer will be an initialize to only the first `numpy.zeros(target / 10)`. In only shaves off about 1/6 of the time on my run though, so I'm not sure it's worth it.

**Part 2:** Do the same thing, only use *11i* instead of *10i* but only to the first 50 multiples.

Nothing much changes:

```python
target = int(sys.argv[1])

presents = numpy.zeros(target / 10)

for i in range(1, target):
    presents[i:i*50:i] += 11 * i

for i in range(len(presents)):
    if presents[i] >= target:
        print(i)
        sys.exit(0)
```
