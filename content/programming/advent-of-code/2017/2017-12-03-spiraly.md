> **Part 1:** Create a grid in a spiral pattern like so:

> ```
17  16  15  14  13
18   5   4   3  12
19   6   1   2  11
20   7   8   9  10
21  22  23---> ...
```

> Given a specific index, what is the [[wiki:Manhattan Distance]]() from that point to the origin (`1`)?

This same sort of structure comes up from time to time in [Project Euler](/programming/sources/project-euler/) as well. I'm going to guess we'll see this again. Seems like a fine contender for a [library function]({{< ref "2017-12-01-library-functions.md" >}}).

Specifically, we'll create a `SpiralGrid` class that can be used to automatically generate as large of a grid as we want lazily (it won't generate more of the grid until we need it).

```python
class SpiralGrid():
    '''
    Generate a spiral grid that looks like this:
    17  16  15  14  13
    18   5   4   3  12
    19   6   1   2  11
    20   7   8   9  10
    21  22  23---> ...

    The point (0, 0) is 1. x runs left to right, y from top to bottom. So the
    point 12 is at (2, -1).
    '''

    def __init__(self):
        self._indexes = {}
        self._points = {}

        def make_spiral():
            index = 1
            (x, y) = (0, 0)

            yield index, (x, y)

            # Build the layers outwards
            for layer in itertools.count(1):
                # Each layer starts by going right and down one (we'll go back up before yielding)
                x += 1
                y += 1

                # Go through the four sides, up then left then down then right
                # Repeat 2*layer times per side
                for xd, yd in [(0, -1), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)]:
                    for step in range(2 * layer):
                        index += 1
                        x += xd
                        y += yd
                        yield index, (x, y)

        self._generator = make_spiral()

    def __getitem__(self, key):
        '''
        Given an index or point return the other.

        If we're given an integer, it's an index, return the point.
        If we're given a tuple, it's a point, return the index.

        Either way, generate as much data as we need and don't have.
        '''

        if isinstance(key, int):
            field = self._indexes
        elif isinstance(key, str):
            key = int(key)
            field = self._indexes
        elif isinstance(key, tuple) and len(key) == 2:
            field = self._points
        else:
            raise ValueError

        while key not in field:
            index, point = next(self._generator)
            self._indexes[index] = point
            self._points[point] = index

        return field[key]
```

The neat part here is using a {{< doc python generator >}} to generate the coordinates of points. That way, we can run the generator until we find the point we're looking for and cache any results for later.

I'm also using a trick I've used before where I'm indexing with a tuple. So we can do things like this:

```python
>>> import lib

>>> grid = lib.SpiralGrid()

>>> grid[0, 0]
1

>>> grid[1]
(0, 0)

>>> grid[3, 4]
80

>>> grid[80]
(3, 4)
```

That's pretty cool if I do say so myself[^ido]. :)

Now that we have the grid, we can get any point we want and then calculate the distance:

```python
lib.add_argument('index')

grid = lib.SpiralGrid()

x, y = grid[lib.param('index')]
print(abs(x) + abs(y))
```

Coolio.    

> **Part 2:** Rather than numbering the grid `1, 2, 3...`, assign each grid point a value equal to the sum of neighbors already assigned. As an example, the center of the grid would look like this:

> ```
17  16  15  14  13
18   5   4   3  12
19   6   1   2  11
20   7   8   9  10
21  22  23---> ...
```

... well that's fun. I made my cool abstract spiral, but it doesn't support this (there's no way to know specifically what order it's generating points in). We can be a bit creative though, since we do know it will generate points in order. Start with the center point and calculate our `sum_of_neighbors` ourselves.


```python
grid = lib.SpiralGrid()

values = {}
values[0, 0] = 1

for i in itertools.count(2):
    x, y = grid[i]

    # Calculate sum of neighbor values we've already calculated for the new value
    sum_of_neighbors = sum(
        values[x + xd, y + yd]
        for xd in (-1, 0, 1)
        for yd in (-1, 0, 1)
        if (not xd == yd == 0) and (x + xd, y + yd) in values
    )
    values[x, y] = sum_of_neighbors

    # As soon as we see one bigger than the given index, bail out
    if sum_of_neighbors > int(lib.param('index')):
        print(sum_of_neighbors)
        break
```

It's a bit ugly, but it works.

Now I just hope we do actually use that `SpiralGrid` again later...[^nope]

It's cool how quick this is for something that seems like it could be relatively complicated:

```bash
$ python3 run-all.py day-03

day-03  python3 spiraly.py 347991 --part 1      0.6469540596008301      480
day-03  python3 spiraly.py 347991 --part 2      0.0639350414276123      349975
```

[^ido]: And I do. That's pretty cool[^ido].
[^nope]: Hint: We don't.
