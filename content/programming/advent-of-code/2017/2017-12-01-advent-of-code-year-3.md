As I did with [last year]({{< ref "2016-12-01-advent-of-code-year-2.md" >}}) / [yesterday]({{< ref "2016-12-01-advent-of-code-year-2.md" >}}), I've written up a series of posts for the Advent of Code 2017 problems. Again, I didn't manage to write them up as I did them, but this time around I least I finished mostly on time.

<!--more-->

As before, these problems are best if you take a crack at solving them yourself first. If that's your thing as well, *stop reading*. This post isn't going anywhere.

If you'd like to see the full form of any particular solution, you can do so on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/jpverkamp/advent-of-code">jpverkamp/advent-of-code</a>

My particular favorites this year:

- [Day 9: Garbage Gobbler]({{< ref "2017-12-09-garbage-gobbler.md" >}}) - Uses [PyParsing](http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/) to parse an interesting input language
- [Day 10: Knot Cool]({{< ref "2017-12-10-knot-cool.md" >}}) - Implement a custom hashing function
- [Day 11: It's Full of Hexagons]({{< ref "2017-12-11-its-full-of-hexagons.md" >}}) - Movement on a hex grid
- [Day 14: Knot Hash Gridinator]({{< ref "2017-12-14-knot-hash-gridinator.md" >}}) - Re-using [day 10's]({{< ref "2017-12-10-knot-cool.md" >}}) hash function + visualization
- [Day 16: Swing Your Partner]({{< ref "2017-12-16-swing-your-partner.md" >}}) - Optimization that cut runtime from two hours to less than a second
- [Day 18: DuetVM]({{< ref "2017-12-18-duetvm.md" >}}) - [[wiki:Virtual machines]]() and programmatically generated music. What could be better?
- [Day 20: Miniature Universe Simulator]({{< ref "2017-12-20-miniature-universe-simulator.md" >}}) - Particular simulation + cool animated gifs
- [Day 21: Fractal Expander]({{< ref "2017-12-21-fractal-expander.md" >}}) - Procedurally generated images + more animated gifs
- [Day 22: DuetVMC]({{< ref "2017-12-23-duetvmc.md" >}}) - Compile DuetVM code to Python, plus reading assembly and hand optimizations

Or a full list of all of the posts:

And if you're curious, here are links to the two previous years:

- [Advent of Code 2015]({{< ref "2015-12-01-advent-of-code-week-1.md" >}})
- [Advent of Code 2016]({{< ref "2016-12-01-advent-of-code-year-2.md" >}})

Perhaps next year I can do this on time again. :smile:
