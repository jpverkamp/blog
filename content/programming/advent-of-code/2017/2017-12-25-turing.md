> **Part 1:** Implement a {{< wikipedia "Turing machine" >}} defined as such:

> ```text
Begin in state A.
Perform a diagnostic checksum after 6 steps.

In state A:
  If the current value is 0:
    - Write the value 1.
    - Move one slot to the right.
    - Continue with state B.
  If the current value is 1:
    - Write the value 0.
    - Move one slot to the left.
    - Continue with state B.

...
```

Most of this problem actually came down to reading the input:

```python
# Map of (current state, current value, key) -> value
# key is one of value, offset, state
transitions = {}
breakpoint = 0
state = None
pointer = 0
one_bits = set()

for line in lib.input():
    line = line.strip('- ')
    arg = line.split()[-1][:-1]

    if arg == 'steps':
        arg = line.split()[-2]

    try:
        arg = int(arg)
    except:
        pass

    # Store values based on that argument
    if line.startswith('Begin'):
        state = arg
    elif line.startswith('Perform'):
        breakpoint = arg
    elif line.startswith('In'):
        current_state = arg
    elif line.startswith('If'):
        current_value = arg
    elif line.startswith('Write'):
        transitions[current_state, current_value, 'value'] = arg == 1
    elif line.startswith('Move'):
        transitions[current_state, current_value, 'offset'] = 1 if arg == 'right' else -1
    elif line.startswith('Continue'):
        transitions[current_state, current_value, 'state'] = arg
```

As we did in part 1 of [day 22]({{< ref "2017-12-22-langtons-ant.md" >}}), we'll use a `set` to store the current state (store `1`, if an index is not in the `set`, it's `0`). That gives us the ability to grow unbounded (so long as we have enough RAM).

Once you have that, actually running the Turing machine is pretty straight forward:

```python
for tick in range(breakpoint):
    value = 1 if pointer in one_bits else 0

    if value and not transitions[state, value, 'value']:
        one_bits.remove(pointer)
    elif not value and transitions[state, value, 'value']:
        one_bits.add(pointer)

    pointer += transitions[state, value, 'offset']
    state = transitions[state, value, 'state']

print(len(one_bits))
```

It's not the fastest thing in the world, but it works well enough:

```bash
$ python3 run-all.py day-25

day-25  python3 turing.py input.txt     79.73910212516785       2870
```

Since it's the last day, there's only one part. A fun year. Check out the [index post]({{< ref "2017-12-01-advent-of-code-year-3.md" >}}) for a list of this year's posts.

Merry Christmas! :snowman:
