**Part 1:** Mine Adventcoins. Basically, find the lowest integer such that the string `{prefix}{integer}` has an {{< wikipedia "md5" >}} hash with at least 5 leading zeros. [^1][^2][^3]

<!--more-->

```python
def naturals(i = 0):
    while True:
        yield i
        i += 1

def mine(prefix, length):
    for i in naturals(1):
        coin = '{prefix}{suffix}'.format(prefix = prefix, suffix = i).encode('utf-8')
        hash = hashlib.md5(coin).hexdigest()
        if all(c == '0' for c in hash[0:length]):
            return (i, hash)

print(mine(sys.argv[1], 5))
```

`naturals` is code that I've used on a number of previous occasions and basically ~~stole~~ borrowed from Racket's {{< doc racket "n-naturals" >}}. It allows you to iterate indefinitely over the {{< wikipedia "natural numbers" >}}. Then, just hash and look for enough leading zeros.

**Part 2:** Do the same thing, only with six leading zeros.

Nothing changes; just change the `length` parameter and wait a bit longer. Moderns computers can still crunch through a whole heck of a lot of hashes (9958218 for my particular input) in next to no time at all.

[^1]: This is actually roughly exactly how Bitcoin mining works.
[^2]: I should post about that sometime.
[^3]: Oh hey, [I did]({{< ref "2014-02-16-exploring-parallelism-in-racket-with-sha-512-mining.md" >}})
