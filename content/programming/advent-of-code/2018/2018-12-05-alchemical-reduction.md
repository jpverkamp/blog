### Source: [Alchemical Reduction](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/5)

> **Part 1:** Given a string, reduce it by removing pairs of letters that are the same letter but different cases. Repeat until you have a minimal string.

<!--more-->

This is the sort of problem Racket excels at: it's basically a list processing problem. First, we want to define a helper function to test for reactions:

```racket
; Two units react if they are the same type (letter) and opposite polarity (case)
(define (react? a b)
  (and (not (eq? a b))
       (eq? (char-downcase a)
            (char-downcase b))))
```

After that, the core recursive function that will take a a list of characters and react through it once. This isn't quite enough to solve the problem (since after removing characters you might expose a new pair), but will do most of it:

```racket
; Collapse all unit pairs that can one time
(define (collapse-once ls)
  (match ls
    ; If The first two units react, remove them
    [(list-rest a b rest)
     #:when (react? a b)
     (collapse-once rest)]
    ; Otherwise, if we have at least one item, process the rest
    [(list-rest a rest)
     (list* a (collapse-once rest))]
    ; Base case: nothing left
    [else
     ls]))
```

I really like {{< doc racket match >}}. It's really powerful for things like this, especially with the addition of the `#:when` clause (which I actually just learned/re-learned about today). I'll be using more of that!

Now, we just need a function that will collapse until it cannot any more:

```racket
Collapse until there's nothing more to do
(define (collapse ls)
 (let ([ls^ (collapse-once ls)])
   (if (equal? ls ls^)
       ls
       (collapse ls^))))

(define input-polymer (string->list (read-line)))
(define output-polymer (collapse input-polymer))
(printf "[part 1] output length: ~a\n" (length output-polymer))
```

> **Part 2:** If you're allowed to remove one letter (both cases), what is the letter you can remove to get the smallest collapsed output (and that output's length).

Let's just brute force it. Write a helper that can remove both cases of a letter from the string and try every letter of the alphabet:

```racket
; Remove all instances of a unit (either polarity)
(define (remove/ignore-case ls c)
  (filter (Î» (a) (not (eq? (char-downcase a) (char-downcase c)))) ls))

; Try removing each letter in turn, recording each new best
(define-values (best-to-remove best-length)
  (for*/fold ([best-to-remove #f]
              [best-length +inf.0])
             ([to-remove (in-string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz")]
              [length (in-value (length (collapse (remove/ignore-case input-polymer to-remove))))]
              #:when (< length best-length))
    (values to-remove length)))

(printf "[part 2] removing ~a gives a length of: ~a\n" best-to-remove best-length)
```

It's a bit slow (a couple seconds per collapse, but it has to do 27 of them for the two parts), but it's certainly workable:

```bash
$ cat input.txt | time racket alchemical-collapser.rkt

[part 1] output length: 9078
[part 2] removing u gives a length of: 5698
       36.88 real        32.77 user         1.07 sys
```

Well within a minute (my baseline for 'efficient enough' for these sort of problems).

I do wonder though if there's a faster way to solve this part? I bet there is. Probably something to do with {{< wikipedia "graph theory" >}}. It's always graph theory.

A problem for another day.
