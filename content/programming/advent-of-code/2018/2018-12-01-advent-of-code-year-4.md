Let's do it again! I'm starting a day late, but much better than [last year]({{< ref "2017-12-01-advent-of-code-year-3.md" >}}) :smile:!

This time around, I'm hoping to solve each problem in both Python and Racket, both to show an example of how the languages differ and ... well, because I can :innocent:.

As always, these problems are wonderful to try to solve yourself. If you agree, *stop reading now*. This post isn't going anywhere.

If you'd like to see the full form of any particular solution, you can do so on GitHub (including previous years and possibly some I haven't written up yet): <a href="https://github.com/jpverkamp/advent-of-code">jpverkamp/advent-of-code</a>

Here's a full list of all of the posts:

And here are my previous year's solutions:
