As I did [last year]({{< ref "2015-12-01-advent-of-code-week-1.md" >}}), I'm going to solve the Advent of Code problems again this year.

Or that was the plan. It turns out that instead I put down my blog for almost a year and a half and never quite got around to doing these problems. So I'm actually backdating these posts from the early days of 2018 to where they would have been had I solved them on time. They're still interesting problems, so give them a read.

If you'd like to see all of the solutions, here's a list:

{{< taxonomy-list "series" "Advent of Code 2016" >}}

Like I noted last year, I generally feel that these problems are more interesting if you take a crack at solving them yourself first. If you feel the same way, *stop reading*. This post will still be here when you're done, I promise.

If you'd like to see all of my solutions (even before I've posted them), they're on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/jpverkamp/advent-of-code">jpverkamp/advent-of-code</a>

If you've solved the puzzles as well and posted your solutions, post a link below. I'd love to see how others approach the problems.

Here is a link to last year's posts:

- [Advent of Code 2015]({{< ref "2015-12-01-advent-of-code-week-1.md" >}})

My particular favorites are:

- [Day 5: Password Cracker]({{< ref "2016-12-05-password-cracker.md" >}}) - Animated output
- [Day 7: IPv7 Support Counter]({{< ref "2016-12-07-ipv7-support-counter.md" >}}) - Regular expressions used in interesting ways
- [Day 11: Radiation Avoider]({{< ref "2016-12-11-radiation-avoider.md" >}}) - Quite a problem in optimization
- [Day 12: Assembunny]({{< ref "2016-12-12-assembunny.md" >}}) - I enjoy writing virtual machines
- [Day 13: Noisy Puzzle]({{< ref "2016-12-14-bad-one-time-pads.md" >}}) - I rather enjoy [procedural content](/programming/topics/procedural-content/)
- [Day 14: Bad One-Time Pads]({{< ref "2016-12-14-bad-one-time-pads.md" >}}) - Not useful as an actual {{< wikipedia "one-time pad" >}} (they're {{< wikipedia deterministic >}}), but interesting to calculate
- [Day 21: Scrambler]({{< ref "2016-12-21-scrambler.md" >}}) - Another virtual machine of sorts
- [Day 23: Assembunny v2]({{< ref "2016-12-23-assembunny2.md" >}}) - An extension of [day 12]({{< ref "2016-12-12-assembunny.md" >}}) involving {{< wikipedia "self-modifying code" >}} and an {{< wikipedia "optimizing compiler" >}}
- [Day 25: Assembunny v3]({{< ref "2016-12-23-assembunny2.md" >}}) - An extension of [day 12]({{< ref "2016-12-12-assembunny.md" >}}) involving simple binary output and loop detection
