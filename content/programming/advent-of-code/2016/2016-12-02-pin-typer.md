> **Part 1:** Take a keypad with the following layout:

> ```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

> Using the instructions UDLR for Up, Down, Left, and Right respectively, move a 'finger' around over the keypad. At the end of each line of instructions, output the current digit.

First, let's define the grid. We'll use the same trick with complex numbers as [last time]{{< ref "2016-12-01-taxicab-simulator.md" >}}.

```python
grid = {
    '-1-1j': 1, '+0-1j': 2, '+1-1j': 3,
    '-1+0j': 4, '+0+0j': 5, '+1+0j': 6,
    '-1+1j': 7, '+0+1j': 8, '+1+1j': 9,
}
```

From there, we can move around the grid, make sure we don't move off the end, and output a character at the end of each line:

```python

location = 0+0j
deltas = {'U':  0-1j, 'L': -1+0j, 'R':  1+0j, 'D':  0+1j}
code = ''

with open(args.input_file, 'r') as fin:
    for line in fin:
        for command in line.strip():
            new_location = location + deltas[command]
            if new_location in grid:
                location = new_location

        code += str(grid[location])
```

> **Part 2:** Use the following keypad instead:

> ```
- - 1 - -
- 2 3 4 -
5 6 7 8 9
- A B C -
- - D - -
```

This is actually a kind of neat extension to the problem. The solution is the same, but the input has to change. What I did for this was to load the grid from a file (so any arbitrary grid shape can be used):

```python
grid = {}

with open(args.grid_file, 'r') as fin:
    for imag, line in enumerate(fin):
        if not line.strip(): continue

        for real, char in enumerate(line.strip()):
            if char != '-':
                grid[complex(real, imag)] = char

            if char == '5':
                location = complex(real, imag)
```

It would be interesting to use a grid like this:

```
1 2 - 3 4
5 - - - 6
7 8 9 0 A
```

Or even one with discontinuities.

A neat problem.
