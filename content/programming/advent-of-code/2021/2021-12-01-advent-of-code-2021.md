Been a while since I've done an advent of code! I'll probably backfill a few years eventually, but for now, let's just write some code!

As always, these problems are wonderful to try to solve yourself. If you agree, *stop reading now*. This post isn't going anywhere.

If you'd like to see the full form of any particular solution, you can do so on GitHub (including previous years and possibly some I haven't written up yet): <a href="https://github.com/jpverkamp/advent-of-code">jpverkamp/advent-of-code</a>

Here's a full list of all of the posts:

{{< taxonomy-list "series" "Advent of Code 2021" >}}

And here's the current testing harness I'm using:

```python
problems = [
    [1, '01', 'Sonar Sweep', 'depth-finder.py', {
        'part1': 'input.txt',
        'part2': 'input.txt 3',
        'part2-simple': 'input.txt 3'
    }],
    ...
]

for day, folder, name, file, variants in problems:
    print(f'--- Day {day}: {name} ---\n')

    for cmd, args in variants.items():
        print(f'$ python3 {file} {cmd} {args}')

        start = time.perf_counter_ns()
        subprocess.check_call(f'python3 {file} {cmd} {args}', shell=True, cwd=folder)
        end = time.perf_counter_ns()

        print(f'# time {end-start}ns / {(end-start)/1e9:.2f}s\n')
```

And here are my previous year's solutions:
