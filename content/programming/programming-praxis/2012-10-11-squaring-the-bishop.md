Okay, this one was just neat. Based on [word-squares source](https://github.com/jpverkamp/small-projects/blob/master/blog/word-squares.rkt). I've only tested it in <a href="http://racket-lang.org/" title="(((? Racket)))">Racket 5.3+</a>, but newer versions should work as well. Racket 5.2 won't work without some tweaking as (at the very least) it's missing a definition for `string-trim`.
