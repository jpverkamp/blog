One thing that I've been meaning to do for a long time is make more things. To that end, when my family needed a new set of containers to hold socks and underwear and the like, I designed one!

It has been a long time since I've used CAD programs, but it's all starting to come back to me. 

It's actually two seperate halves (helps a bit with the weight) and could be stacked, although we have them side by side. 

Files:

* [SketchUp model v2](/embeds/maker/sock-and-underwear-drawer/model-v2.skp)
* [Cutlist (for v2)](/embeds/maker/sock-and-underwear-drawer/cutsheet-v2.pdf)

I did fall back to SketchUp 2017. I don't really want a web based program for everything, although that seems to be more and more the way. Plus, the 2017 version has a free (for non-commercial use) version with extensions!

My goal for this was to make it entirely out of one thickness of MDF (I settled on 3/4", which made it *heavy*). I started by laying out the sides with their angled edges and then put a backing board on it. The hardest part was the front angled piece (just below the actual front piece), which should actually be thinner than 3/4". But it worked out well enough. 

I think that my favorite part of SketchUp was that it can generate a cutlist (with an extension, that's why I used the 2017 version)!

Pretty cool. 

I'm going to do more of this!
