title: 2D COVID-19 Ornament
date: 2020-12-22

This... has been quite a year. As I'm sure everyone is well aware. But hey, it gave me the perfect chance to make a unique ornament for my mother (she's always asking) that really represents the year.

:D

This was actually really quick to lay out. Essentially:

* Find the [covid image](/embeds/maker/covid-ornaments/2d/covid.png) I wanted[^uhoh]
* If the image was not already an SVG, use [an online converter](https://www.pngtosvg.com/) to [make it into one]((/embeds/maker/covid-ornaments/2d/covid.svg) (one color)
* Upload the SVG to Tinkercad
* Create a cylinder as a 'hole' in one of the top bits for an ornament hanger
* Add a rectangle in the center so the holes don't interfere
* Add the 2020 text on top of that, but don't cut all the way through, since you'll lose the center of the zeroes

* Export as STL
* Use [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura) to slice it
* Print

They're small and flat, so I can print one in an hour and change. Made a few for family and of course one for us. If you'd like me to print one, feel free to [send me an email](mailto:blog@jverkamp.com). No charge except shipping. Merry Christmas, as much as it can be this year. 

[^uhoh]: So. Disclaimer time. I can't actually find the original source for this image any more. I expect there might be a copywrite on it, but I hope not. Since it was primarily for personal use, I didn't mind overmuch, but now that I'm sharing it, that's a bit more fuzzy. If it's your image, let me know. If I find the original source (and I can't use it), I'll redesign the image and update this post. (I guess I could just draw one, it's not a complicated image.)
