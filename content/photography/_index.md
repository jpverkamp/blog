title: "Photography"

I've always had a soft spot for photography. I borrowed my mother's camera in high school and eventually bought my own. These days, I mostly use my phone (it's amazing how good those have gotten), but I still pull out my years old DSLR from time to time. 

Mostly, I have pictures organized by photosets, but I've started adding a few 'meta sets' like [Mini Worlds]({{< ref "2018-11-23-mini-worlds" >}}), [Bugs etc (macros)]({{< ref "2020-08-01-bugs-etc-macros" >}}), and [Fungus Among Us]({{< ref "2020-11-27-fungus-among-us" >}}).
