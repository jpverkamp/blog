The <a title="Yes, a gaming tavern! | AFK Tavern" href="http://www.afktavern.com/">AFK Tavern</a> is amazing. Full stop.

Where else can you get a menu that looks like an RPG rulebook and has items like the Poached Spaghetti Monster, +2 Tots, or the Reaver (I had that, it's huge...). You can check out their <a title="AFK Tavern Menu" href="http://files.afktavern.com/menu1.0.pdf">online menu</a>, but really just go check the place out. It's well worth it.

Of course, I have a few Photosynths for the occasions. First, our neighboring table. Playing Magic: The Gathering, which only reinforces how awesome this place is. If you look down, you can see that we're playing Zombie Munchkin. They have games there that you can "order" and that they'll bring to your table, free of charge. It really is a gamer's paradise.

And this is going to sound really strange, but if you do make it there, make sure you go to the rest room. Why? It's the only place I've ever seen that has graffiti in runes (either {{< wikipedia "Futhark" >}} or perhaps Tolkein's {{< wikipedia page="Cirth" text="Dwarven Runes" >}}--I'm hoping to figure out which and translate them, I just haven't gotten around to it yet):
