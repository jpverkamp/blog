While I was at [Usenix/FOCI]({{< ref "2012-08-06-usenix-foci-2012.md" >}}), I met up with my parents who were in Portland anyways for a wedding. Since I had Tuesday off from the conference, we decided to explore Seattle. I didn't have my camera with me, but I did have my iPhone, so I decided to play with the (amazing) <a title="iTunes App Store: Photosynt" href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CF8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fphotosynth%2Fid430065256%3Fmt%3D8&amp;ei=fqIuUKK2H-KbyQHcq4DICg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHcHlb1n5RnBpJwaOI0zJSjC7vw4w&amp;sig2=KDbGFNYkM3USfjgVmtWjHw">Photosynth app</a>.

Yes, it's Microsoft and Apple products working together, but that doesn't mean you can't have fun with it!

Here are a few of the shots I took with it. Oh, and make sure you click the full screen button at the bottom of each Photosynth. It's worth it.

Since I'm not quite comfortable with the app yet, there are a few stitching artifacts, but I'm getting better.

On Pier 50, before we got on the ferry to West Seattle:

On the ferry to West Seattle, near Pier 50:

Leaving Seattle behind:

Arrival in West Seattle (yes, the flag got pretty badly artifact'ed):

Unfortunately, my phone battery was almost dead at this point (it takes about 3-5% for each Photosynth and I'd already been using it this morning) so I don't have any more from here, but I'll try to charge it again and get some more from the trip.
