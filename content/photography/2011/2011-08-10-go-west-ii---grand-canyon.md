Several photosets from our family vacation on the west coast. We started in Phoenix, went to a few nearby things, then up the entire west coast to the Olympic Peninsula. 

This is the second set, from the Grand Canyon (and a few from just before or after). This was one our longest stops so it's also probably going to be the largest photoset.
