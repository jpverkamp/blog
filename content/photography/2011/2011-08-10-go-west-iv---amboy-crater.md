Several photosets from our family vacation on the west coast. We started in Phoenix, went to a few nearby things, then up the entire west coast to the Olympic Peninsula. 

This is the fourth set, from Amboy Crater. It wasn't on our schedule and we didn't even know it was there, but when we saw a sign saying 'Crater' we had to stop. Turns out it's a volcano. Who'da thunk?
