Several photosets from our family vacation on the west coast. We started in Phoenix, went to a few nearby things, then up the entire west coast to the Olympic Peninsula. 

Finally to the sixth set. The first few are from a random stop on the way at Pismo Beach and the rest are stereotypical San Francisco shots.
