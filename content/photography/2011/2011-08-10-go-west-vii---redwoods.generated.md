Several photosets from our family vacation on the west coast. We started in Phoenix, went to a few nearby things, then up the entire west coast to the Olympic Peninsula. 

The seventh set, with pictures from the redwoods and a few more coastal shots. The last few are from where we stayed that night in an awesome house tucked into a forest. Wow.
