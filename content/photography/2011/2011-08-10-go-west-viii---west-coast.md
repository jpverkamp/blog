Several photosets from our family vacation on the west coast. We started in Phoenix, went to a few nearby things, then up the entire west coast to the Olympic Peninsula. 

Number eight, up the west coast into Oregon. We're almost there. A few random pictures from a town we stopped in and the evening's sunset.
