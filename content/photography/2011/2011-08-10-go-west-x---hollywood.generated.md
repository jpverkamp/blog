Several photosets from our family vacation on the west coast. We started in Phoenix, went to a few nearby things, then up the entire west coast to the Olympic Peninsula. 

Number ten, the final set. At this point, we'd been driving hard for two days to get back to Phoenix. We stopped in LA though, just so we could take a few pictures of the Hollywood sign.
