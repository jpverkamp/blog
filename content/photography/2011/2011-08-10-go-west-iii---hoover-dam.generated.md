Several photosets from our family vacation on the west coast. We started in Phoenix, went to a few nearby things, then up the entire west coast to the Olympic Peninsula. 

This is the third set, from the Hoover Dam (plus the rest stop before). A fair few fewer than the Grand Canyon, but I thing there are a few fine dam pictures.
