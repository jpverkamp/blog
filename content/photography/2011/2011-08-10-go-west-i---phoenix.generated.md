Several photosets from our family vacation on the west coast. We started in Phoenix, went to a few nearby things, then up the entire west coast to the Olympic Peninsula. 

This is the first set, from Phoenix. We met up with my cousin who works for Intel there. Most are from a drive up to the area just north of Phoenix.
