As a class trip (Religion &amp; Ecology) through Rose-Hulman, myself, over a dozen other students, and two professors embarked on a pair of pilgrimages in Europe.  This set of pictures details the first of the two: From Rochester to Cantebury in England.  We also had a few days at the beginning in London.  The second set is from the Camino de Santiago in Spain.
