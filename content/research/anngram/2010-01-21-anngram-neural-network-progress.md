[As expected]({{< ref "2010-01-12-anngram-neuralnetwork-library.md" >}}), I've decided to change libraries from the** **[poor results with the original tests]({{< ref "2010-01-13-anngram-initial-ann-results.md" >}}) may have been a direct results of a misunderstanding with the code base.Â  I think that the layers were not being hooked up correctly, resulting in low/random values.

Hopefully, using NeuraonDotNet (with it's much greater selection of documentation and examples) will improve the results that I've been getting.
