Pictogenesis

Generation modes
=====
Place pixels (overall)
Massively parallel
Parallel: cellular automaton
Quad tree
SVG/Expression tree output
Turtle/agent based model
Gradient/flow maps (?)
Neural network (input images; NEAT: evolve nodes and connections)
Image transformations

Color modes
=====
Grayscale
RGB
CMYK
Layered alpha
SVG (?)

Script models
=====
Register based, iterative
Stack based, iterative
Register based, expression tree
Functional, expression tree
L-system/grammar (can be generated by choosing which rule or mutating rules)
Declarative based (similar to SQL)
Logic programming (similar to prolog)

Registers
=====
x, y = index into the map (integer or floating point)
c = channel being generated
t = time (used only for animations)
z, k = zero/constants
n[-1,-1] = neighbors (could be a function, used for cellular automaton)
r, g, b / c[i] = output red/green/blue etc channels

Functions
=====
Conditional/flow: if, jump
Math: add, sub, mul, div
Trigonometry: sin, cos, tan
Noise: perlin, simplex
Random: random
Memory: save, load
Parallel: fork, join
