description: "Several photosets from our family vacation on the west coast. We started\
  \ in Phoenix, went to a few nearby things, then up the entire west coast to the\
  \ Olympic Peninsula. \n\nThis is the fourth set, from Amboy Crater. It wasn't on\
  \ our schedule and we didn't even know it was there, but when we saw a sign saying\
  \ 'Crater' we had to stop. Turns out it's a volcano. Who'da thunk?"
