description: "Several photosets from our family vacation on the west coast. We started\
  \ in Phoenix, went to a few nearby things, then up the entire west coast to the\
  \ Olympic Peninsula. \n\nThe fifth set, up the coast. The first half are from Joshua\
  \ Tree National Forest near Twentynine Palms where my cousin is stationed. The latter\
  \ half are from Santa Barbara where we stopped for the beach and the night."
