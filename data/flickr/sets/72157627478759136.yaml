description: "Several photosets from our family vacation on the west coast. We started\
  \ in Phoenix, went to a few nearby things, then up the entire west coast to the\
  \ Olympic Peninsula. \n\nNumber nine: Twilight. It's a combination of Forks, La\
  \ Push, and Port Angeles. Definitely wasn't my primary reason for going, but I'll\
  \ admit that La Push was pretty awesome. And it was neat being on the very northern\
  \ end of the country."
