I 2015, I set myself an <del>ambitious</del> <del>slightly</del> insane reading goal: 100 books.

My final count: exactly 100 books (from ~30 different series), totaling 38,048 pages. There were a few short stories in there (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24330383-pimpf">Pimpf</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8794.Charles_Stross">Charles Stross</a> was the shortest at 25 pages) to offset a couple epic fantasies (1,048 pages in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/38550.Brandon_Sanderson">Brandon Sanderson's</a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17332218-words-of-radiance">Words of Radiance</a>). Overall, I averaged 388 pages/book, which sounds about right to me.

For the longest time, I was average right at 100 pages per day, but over the last week or so (in a last burst to finish the year), that bumped up slightly. I ended up at an average of 104 pages / day. None too shabby.

Rating-wise, I rated a full quarter of the books I read 5 out of 5. Less than 20 were three stars or less. My average rating was 4.2. If that sounds a bit high... it should be. These are the books that I put on my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com">Goodreads</a> list since I wanted to read them. Of those, I took the subset of those that I particularly wanted to read for 2015. So it's no surprise that I (for the most part) selected books I thought I would like.

From my original list (@crosslink{2015 Reading List}), I at least started every series (Mere Christianity I'm reading at two chapters per week, so I'm still working on it). I even added a few that weren't originally on there:

Overall, I greatly enjoyed reading as much as I did. According to Goodreads, I only read 10 in 2014. Perhaps though, I should aim for something in between those two... Look tomorrow for my 2016 reading list.
