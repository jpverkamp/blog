Three more down on my @crosslink{2015 Reading List}: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/49971-kane-chronicles">The Kane Chronicles</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15872.Rick_Riordan">Rick Riordan</a>. This is the same author (and based on a few hints, the same universe) as @crosslink{The Heroes of Olympus} and before that the Percy Jackson series. Basically, it's the same rough idea, except instead of Greek/Roman mythology, we have Egyptian.

On one hand: Egyptian myths are awesome (and weird). There is a lot to mine from that. On the other: Riordan has told essentially the same core story a dozen times now. It's starting to show.

Overall, I liked them. I thought they were weaker than either Percy Jackson or @crosslink{The Heroes of Olympus} but still strong enough on their own merits.

Individual reviews:

Red Pyramid would be a lot strong if I hadn't read Percy Jackson.

Don't get me wrong. Red Pyramid is still a fine book, although it feels like it's written for an even younger audience than Percy Jackson.

A few of the downsides:

<ul>
	<li>Red Pyramid is told 'interview style', as if it were a transcribed copy of an audio recording. It would be fine as a framing device, except there are random interjections between the two narrators that each time pulled me out of the story. They're supposed to be 'witty', but I could have done without them.</li>

	<li>The humor feels younger than Percy Jackson. The five elements: Earth, Air, Fire, Water, and ... Cheese. I guess I'm getting old.</li>

	<li>Despite having two narrators, it was hard to tell who's chapter I was reading at times. Riordan did this much better in the Heroes of Olympus.</li>

	<li>The BAD GUYS were BAD just for the sake of BEING BAD. Even from a kid's book, I would like a little more depth. Although I guess there's something to be said for gods playing a role.</li>
</ul>

On a more positive note:

<ul>
	<li>Egyptian mythology is weird! The flavor does play through several points of the story. Where the Greek and Roman gods felt 'human', the Egyptian gods feel weird. That's a good thing. The hieroglyphics in particular were a neat touch.</li>

	<li>There are hints at a shared universe (the western bank belongs to ... others) without it being overbearing. I don't think I would ever like to see a crossover with the Greek/Roman books, but the possibility is neat in and of itself.</li>

	<li>SUMMON BIGGER BAD. The ending was fairly obvious from early on (and once again strongly echoes Percy Jackson), but it did leave me wanting more.</li>
</ul>

Still. A fun read. Relatively quick. I'll finish the series.

I don't really have particularly much to add for Throne of Fire that I didn't already say for The Red Pyramid.

Basically, more of the same. The Kanes have five days to save the world (it's impressive how even something like that can start to get old after a dozen novels...). They proceed to do so.

One particularly weird part this time: Sadie takes the time in the second day of the novel to go to Londor for her birthday. The fate of the world hangs in the balance... And you can teleport around the world. You can go to London later.

Another slight downside is that this very much feels like the middle book of a trilogy (which of course it is). It works more to set up the third and final book rather than being able to stand by itself. That doesn't necessarily make it bad, but it's not great when it's that obvious.

On the up side, the cast of characters has expanded a bit with a few new trainee godlings brought into the fold, apparently from that audio recording from the first novel.

Still, it was an entertaining enough read and kept me going enough that I still want to finish the trilogy.

A solid ending to the series. Once again the world will end in <i>n</i> days and it's up to Sadie and Carter to save that day.

Really, it feels like the second half of The Throne of Fire. We have the same support characters, the same big bad, the same magic, and it doesn't feel like that terribly much time has passed. Honestly, it's not a bad thing; it's just a little bit weird.

One thing I did like is that the climactic battle did actually feel big. It was a bit rushed, but it was nice to see everything coming together in a bunch of ways. The afterwards with the gods withdrawing was odd, but made sense. There there was a paragraph or two dedicated to setting the stage for a potential Percy Jackson crossover. I mentioned in a previous review: it's neat to think about, but I'm not sure how well it could be done.

So far as downsides, really the same as the previous two books. The meta story of being a transcription of an audio recording is weird. I sometimes couldn't tell which sibling I was reading. But it felt a little less bad this time around. Perhaps I just got used to it?

As I've said before: the series isn't quite as good as either the Greek or Roman series, but stand alone it's still certainly enjoyable. I'm glad I read them.

Next up, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2429135.The_Girl_with_the_Dragon_Tattoo">The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/706255.Stieg_Larsson">Stieg Larsson</a>. Based on the reviews--everyone seems to either love it or hate it--and the genre--I tend not to like stories set in (or that could be set in) the modern real world... I have no idea if I'm going to like it.

We'll find out!
