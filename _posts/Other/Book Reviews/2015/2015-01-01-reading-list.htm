Partially to keep myself honest and partially because I think these books look neat, here is my (entirely too ambitious) current reading list for 2015:

It doesn't look that bad (only 24 books, that's only one every two weeks), until you realize that about 20 of those are the first in a series. And if there's one thing that I don't like doing, it's leaving a (good) book series unfinished... All told, there are actually just over a hundred books on this list (1 every 3 days...). That's a bit taller order.

That being said, I doubt I'll actually finish the entire list, but I'm certainly going to try. If a series is good, I'll read the entire thing. If not... well, life's short.

I'm also considering doing a year in book reviews rather than my normal @crosslink{movie reviews}, seeing as I'm basically not seeing any movies in theaters for the foreseeable future. We'll see.

EDIT: Looks like I'm doing reviews. :) Here's a list:
