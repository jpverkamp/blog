I know I said last post that my next series would be The <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/47749-newsflesh">Newsflesh Trilogy</a>, and that's still the case, but in the mean time, I have a @crosslink{2015 Reading List} review for <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68427.Elantris">Elantris</a> (and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13578175-the-emperor-s-soul">The Emperor's Soul</a>) by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/38550.Brandon_Sanderson">Brandon Sanderson</a>.

Since there are only two and they're not particularly directly related to one another, here are the individual reviews:

I have yet to find a Sanderson novel that I don't particularly like and Elantris is no exception.

Basically, Elantris focuses around the titular city; once a place of wonder and magic which. Ten years ago, all that ended and now it's populated by essentially zombies: those without heartbeats who cannot die and cannot heal. We follow a few different story lines--a princess from another land engaged to the prince who gets Elantrisified in the very beginning of the story; an attempted religious coup from multiple fronts; and the politics of a kingdom/city trying to heal after massive upheaval.

This is his earliest work and in some ways it shows. He actually commented recently on the <a href="http://www.writingexcuses.com/">Writing Excuses</a> podcast that he co-hosts that he's learned a lot about pacing since writing Elantris. Towards the end, I definitely noticed it. In the last 10% or so of the novel, everything comes to a head all at once. I think it could have been even strong had some of the storylines come to fruition earlier.

I did like a lot of the characters. Sarene reminds me strongly of Shallan from The Way of Kings (perhaps because it's the most recent other Sanderson novel I've read), but I think I actually like her more. Raoden seems almost too good to be true, but keeps just enough human trivialities (especially when interacting with Sarene), that I still like him. I particularly grew to like Hrathen. It's always interesting to see how fantasy novels interact with religion.

More than anything, I wish this novel had a sequel. Well, it sort of does in [book: The Emperor's Soul|13578175], although that it in a completely different part of the world. It looks like there is a true sequel in the works though (<a href="http://brandonsanderson.com/faq-will-there-be-a-sequel-to-elantris/">FAQ</a>). Awesome.

If I hadn't been told, at first I wouldn't realize that The Emperor's Soul takes place in a far away corner of the same world as Elantris. But as the story wears on, and the details of the magic system are revealed, it becomes more obvious that the worlds are one and the same. I really do love how Sanderson does magic systems. I've never seen anything quite like it, especially not at the same scale. Every system seems new, yet there's a shared core to all of them. I love it.

Other than that, I did like the character of Shai. There's something about an artist who works entirely to know that she did it, rather than for public acclaim that I enjoy. Sneaky and subtle. Excellent. I could see a few of the twists coming (that she wouldn't escape until the last moment; the changes she made), but that didn't make it any less enjoyable.

One thing I'd love to see if/when that Elantris sequel comes out? A meeting between the worlds. How would a Forger interact with an Elantrian? What about a Bloodsealer? I want to know more about them.

With that, I have only <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1268479.Warbreaker">Warbreaker</a> left among Sanderson's <a href="http://coppermind.net/wiki/Cosmere">Cosmere</a> novels@footnote{I have yet to find an author with a project even near that ambitious... And he's actually pulling it off.} and a few of the non-Cosmere ones.  Dang, he's prolific.

Next up (for real this time): the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/47749-newsflesh">Newsflesh Trilogy</a>.
