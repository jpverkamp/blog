Onward and upward on my @crosslink{2015 Reading List} with #7: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12779838-precinct-13">Precinct 13</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/379444.Tate_Hallaway">Tate Hallaway</a>. It's a little amusing to be reading this back to back with @crosslink{White Trash Zombie}, given that in both cases the main character works in a morgue.

That being said, I think that unfortunately Precinct 13 was a somewhat weaker book. In particular, it had a pair of problems: a @trope{fantasy kitchen sink} and @trope{chosen one} syndrome. Both have the possibility--as do all tropes--of being done well, but in this case I wasn't particularly thrilled with it.

So far as the kitchen sink, I feel like to do it right, you have to either introduce new beasties slowly (that's one thing I liked about both the Dresden Files and @crosslink{The Iron Druid Chronicles}) or just hint about the bigger world. Instead, we're hit pretty immediately over the head with witches and vampire-werewolves and fairies and golems.

Other than that, I don't really like 'chosen one' stories. I think this is less of a general issue and more one that bugs me in particularly. Specifically, I'm not a fan of stories where the main character is unique, with powers (especially unexplainable) unique that no one else has.

That being said, I thought two parts of the world building were neat: the aforementioned @wikipedia{golem} and parts of the magic system. Related to the golem, I don't often see Jewish influences in urban fantasy, so that was neat. I would like to see a little bit more of that. Also, the magic was neat--especially the magical tattoo early in the book and curses literally based on cursing.

Another idea that was interesting was the division between natural and unnatural magic. Basically, you can either use the natural ebb and flow of magic or you can force it to do your bidding. It's an interesting way to bring some prejudice into your story--which Hallaway does--although I think she could have done more with it.

All together, I thought it was a good enough story. I'm a little burned out on urban fantasy at the moment (I'm glad <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3220405-ender-in-exile?from_search=true">Ender in Exile</a> is up next) and I'm not sure I liked Precinct 13 enough to continue with the series when the inevitable sequel comes about, but you could do worse.
