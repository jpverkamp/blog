Confession time: I didn't particularly like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11.The_Hitchhiker_s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>. It seems a bit of blasphemy for a self professed 'geek', but I just don't particularly care for this style of humorous science fiction. A novel with a large helping of humor? Good. Example: @crosslink{The Iron Druid Chronicles}. But when that humor is pushed to the level of world building, that's a bit of a problem.

Specifically, Year Zero starts with an interesting premise: Since the 1970s, aliens have been listening to our music--and they love it. But alien society at large also has a problem: art created by a 'primitive' species is bound by the laws of that species. In this particular case, copyright law. The end result: humanity is now due all of the universe's wealth (for better and for worse). Neat concept, yes?

The problem is that it starts to fall apart almost immediately. The basic conceit is that art is at the core of universal culture. That part seems fine. But in all the millions of species, we are the best at music--by a large margin. A step forward and our music seems universally loved. How that's possible in such a large universe? It's hard to swallow.

On the other hand I did like is the idea that in such a huge universe, just about every sort of alien life is possible. Life that looks like parrots... vacuum cleaners... and life that looks <em>almost</em> exactly like us. That's not a problem though, with that many species, chances are pretty good that one or more would end up just like us.

An interesting note is that the author of the book--<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6423803.Rob_Reid?ref=ru_lihp_nsup_as.6423803_0_mclk">Rob Reid</a> founded the company that developed Rhapsody. So a novel heavily invested with copyright law works well with the idea to 'write what you know'. It shows, with more details about copyright law and musical pop culture references than I personally cared for. I'm not convinced that this is a novel that is going to age well--although I guess that isn't the end of the world.

Otherwise, the characters are a little rough, closer to caricatures at times@footnote{Although to be fair, Hitchhiker's Guide does the same thing}. The plot is a little uneven, taking a while to get moving, then each conclusion in turn--including the finale--comes too suddenly.  When I first started Year Zero, I wasn't sure that I was even going to finish it. Around 20% in, something clicked and suddenly it was a few hours later and I'd finished it. If you liked the Hitchhiker's Guide, you'll probably like this book.

Counting my side trip into the @crosslink["The Ender Quintet"]{Enderverse}, that puts me at 39 books just shy of the first 4 months. 100 books sounded mad at first, but I'm really enjoying it. It's nice to be reading again.
