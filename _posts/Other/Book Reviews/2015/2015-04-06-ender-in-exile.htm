<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/589.Orson_Scott_Card">Orson Scott Card's</a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/375802.Ender_s_Game">Ender's Game</a> has long been among my favorite science fiction novels@footnote{Which is why I was particularly saddened by the movie adaptation of @crosslink{Ender's Game}}, ever since I first read it years ago. I've always found it interesting how, given the two branches of sequels to Ender's Game, most people prefer one or the other, either <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/43963-the-ender-quintet">Ender's Quintet</a> or <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/40409-ender-s-shadow">Ender's Shadow</a>. Personally, I tend towards the former, perhaps because I read it first, perhaps because it's more science fictiony and philosophical rather than militaristic and political.

So when I recently realized that between when I last read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7967.Speaker_for_the_Dead">Speaker for the Dead</a> et al, a new book had been released: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3220405-ender-in-exile">Ender in Exile</a>, taking place between Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead. So of course I had to read it.

<!--more-->

If you're familiar with the other novels in the Ender Quintet, Ender in Exile takes place between the end of the war in Ender's Game and the events some 3000 years later in Speaker for the Dead. It details the first world (and to some extent, the second) that Ender visits, overlapping with and somewhat replacing the final chapter of Ender's Game.

All together, it's a solid enough book. I enjoy--as I always have--the character of Ender, although he remains from time to time too perfect. I enjoy reading about some of the other characters in this world as well, especially the captain (he's a jerk, but a well characterized one) and the family from Italy. I still don't quite get Valentine, but she's not so odd

One thing that felt completely different about this book was how it edged on preachy at times. Long swathes of the book were dedicated to ideas from evolutionary psychology espousing monogamy, even in cases where there is a severe gender imbalance (as is the case with the initial soldiers turned colonists). It wasn't quite enough enough to kick me entirely out of the story, but it's something to keep in mind.

Another oddity is a problem that always comes up with prequels. Strictly speaking, Ender in Exile isn't supposed to be a prequel, but since it was written after books 3-5 of the Ender Quintent (and I read it after as well), there is a certain amount of knowing what will happen throughout the book that takes away a certain something. Add to that the chunk in the center of the book originally published (and I originally read) as the short story Gold Bug@footnote{Which is actually a really neat story. I wish there was more about that. @emoji{smile}}, and it feels just a bit messy.

As an aside, I had not previously read the novella <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/552987.A_War_of_Gifts">A War of Gifts</a>, set during Ender's time at Battle School, so I took a chance to do so now. On the upside, it's a really interesting look both at how a dedicated pacifist would fare at Battle School (although if a six year old could remain so dedicated) and one of the few times in the time at Battle School that the children actually feel like children. It usually doesn't bother me, but it's nice to have at least this little nod. On the downside, I see no reason why Ender had to save the day yet again. It's a big school. Is there really no one anywhere nearly as good at reading people and understanding them as Ender is?

All together, I enjoyed both rereading Ender's Game and reading the new (for me) Ender in Exile. It's almost enough to get me to reread the rest of The Ender Quintet. We'll see. Instead though, I'm actually going to inject an aside to my @crosslink{2015 Reading List} and stay in the Enderverse a little while longer at least with the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/72732-the-first-formic-war">First Formic War</a> trilogy. After that? Who knows!
