Back to a nice bit of science fiction: the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/52279-spin-saga">Spin Saga</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/27276.Robert_Charles_Wilson">Robert Charles Wilson</a>.

It's an interesting trilogy, starting with big idea science fiction reflecting on the personal level of the characters (check out the individual review for Spin for a bit more detail). The second is quite a bit weaker, not quite as 'big' as the first book. The third is pretty solid again, although it's structurally odd.

(minor spoilers; although nothing more than used to be on the Goodreads summary)

I really enjoy science fiction where they take a really big / weird idea and just run with it. Spin is exactly that sort of book. In a nutshell, one night all of the stars seem to go out. Over the book, the protagonists discover that not the stars didn't actually go out, but rather the Earth was enveloped in a shell that is causing time on Earth to run roughly 100 million times slower, while at the same time preventing any ill effects therefrom.

It's a really cool idea and lets the author really jump through time in a way that not many novels can successfully pull off. On the level of the characters, we follow the main characters from the time the stars go out when they are children through the rest of their lives, jumping sometimes decades at a time (roughly in two different timeslines: one starting at age 10 and jumping forward, the other staying relatively constant towards the end of the timeline). On the scale of the rest of the universe, our sun grows old and warms the rest of the solar system, the stars all move about, and our galaxy even collides with another. 

There is an interesting mix of high level science fiction on how the world changes as an impact of the Spin (the name of the shell enclosing the Earth for reasons that I never quite caught) with the low level lives of the characters. I didn't particularly like any of the characters, which is unfortunate, but having them ground the story was I still think a good choice. 

Overall, solid big-idea science fiction. Well worth the read.

Unfortunately, many of the other reviewers here are on point. In Spin, we followed the lives of a small groups of characters while <i>big ideas</i> happened around them, spanning either decades or billions of years, depending on your perspective. In Axis, the ideas are not nearly as big, the timespan isn't quite so vast, and the cast of characters has changed to ones I don't find myself caring about as much.

There is a bit of an interesting follow up here to the last chapter of Spin: what's on the other side of the arch and just what <i>are</i> the Hypotheticals. I think the first could make an interesting story all of itself, just following a series of explorers further and further through the worlds, but that's not what Axis is. And so far as the second--we don't really learn anything new. There are hints of something bigger (which is saying something, given something on a scale with the entire galaxy) and a few smaller neat ideas, but nothing quite comes together.

All together, I think one can either read just Spin or read the entire series (since from what I've read, Vortex is more of a sequel to Axis than either was directly to Spin). Looks like we'll give Vortex a chance.

After the strong opening in Spin and the someone meh followup with Axis, I wasn't expecting particularly much from Vortex. Consider me pleasantly surprised.

Getting back to the huge events and big timespans of Spin, Vortex takes place ten thousand years after Axis, after the Temporal Arch discovered towards the end of that book ends its next cycle. Two of Axis' main characters (Turn and Isaac) are dumped out / recreated and picked up by a island sized ship that has been floating through arch after arch through the Eight Worlds (apparently the arches connecting Earth to Equatoria connect through several other worlds and finally end at Mars, which is a neat concept). 

The far future society is interesting, as is the ruined Earth (global warming is bad). In the far future, societies seem to resolve around linked communities, either linking the thoughts of emotions of a community. The island they end up on is one of the latter, which has both its strengths but also a fair number of complexities, both of which I thought Vortex did an interesting job of exploring.

On the other hand, there is actually a second story line interwoven into Vortex, revealing the ten thousand year future as a story written by a possible mental health patient. Honestly, I'm not sure why this storyline is here; I thought those parts weren't nearly as interesting (we've already seen that part of the timeline after the Spin) and could have been left out. They did set up an interesting possibility for the very conclusion, but that could have done without as well.

We also do learn more about the Hypotheticals (not so hypothetical any more...), which remains a neat concept, even if one that doesn't always make terribly much sense (how do they communicate?). 

Overall, my previous point from Axis remains: If you read Axis, read all three. Vortex is a solid conclusion and an interesting book on its own merits. If you're more pressed for time, you can read only Spin and be well off.

That puts me at 89 for the year, slightly behind where I should be. Trying to read a book every 3.65 days on top of @crosslink["NaNoWriMo 2015"]{writing a novel} is... fun. Onwards though!

Next up, I'm going to finish the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/99602-powder-mage">Powder Mage Trilogy</a>. The first book wasn't the best I've ever read, but it was good enough to give the other two a chance. Plus, I'm hoping for a few more answers. :smile:
