Continuing on the Enderverse kick after @crosslink{Ender in Exile}, I've just finished <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/72732-the-first-formic-war">The First Formic War</a> trilogy, a collaboration (of sorts) between <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/55830.Aaron_Johnston">Aaron Johnston</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/589.Orson_Scott_Card">Orson Scott Card</a>. From that I think you actually get to the root of one of many of the oddities of the book: The story originated as a pair of comic books: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10644801-formic-wars">Burning Earth</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13528662-formic-wars">Silent Strike</a>. I'm not sure how much of those (or the latter novels which I actually read) was written by Card and how much was co-written, but any time you get a collaboration in what was originally a single author's universe, strange things can happen.

The first of the issues this raises I already mentioned in my review of @crosslink{Ender in Exile}. When you write a series of books out of chronological order, it's extremely easy to contradict yourself. In this case, there was really one sticking point: gravity manipulation technology. In Ender's Game (let alone the sequels), it's made relatively clear that humanity only learned to manipulate gravity from the formics. But in the First Formic War, there are two different groups using gravity technology, one for mining (in a way that sounds an awful lot like the Little Doctor) and the other for propulsion.

Now, it's entirely possible to explain this away in universe as Ender just being too young or others not even knowing that this was the case--except Mazer Rackham was one of the pilots of the planes using the gravity manipulation technology. So...

Now that is off of my chest though, I actually greatly enjoyed the series. I like it when you have multiple completely different points of view or time in a shared universe, so that you can see how some difference play out. I also liked the aspect of the First Formic War taking place when humanity is just starting to expand out into the solar system, with a colonies on other rocks (the moon and asteroids at least) and even mining in the Kuiper Belt. It's a segment of science fiction that isn't that common, so it was nice to see it here.

Next, the characters. There was definiately some give and take here. I liked Victor and his family. I thought their family dynamic was interesting, even if it did edge into the 'children are far smarter than adults' trope that the Enderverse relies fairly heavily upon. One interesting contrast was a bit right at the beginning of the first book about relationships in a closely related, isolated population. It got just as preachy as Ender in Exile, but for whatever reason, I thought this time it was more deserved and done much better.

On the other hand, I wasn't overly thrilled with the character of Lem. I get that there are people that think that, that are so set in their world view and so sure that everyone is out to get them that they cannot see it any other way. I even get that those can make interesting characters in fiction. He just really grated on me. I wish there had been more growth and change for him.

Third and final, Mazer Rackham and the MOPs were interesting. There's certainly an undertone of military worship (but only 'smart' military worship) going on as many of the Enderverse books have, but I think I liked how it worked out here. What I didn't care for as much was how obvious (at least to me) many of their political maneuverings and military tactics were. Need to justify military action in China? Publicly thank a high powered general ahead of time so he cannot back down without looking a fool. Need some way to attack under the landers? Oh hey, we happen to have these drills...

All that said and done, it's not bad. I'm looking forward to if/when the detail the Second Formic War even more. For now though, I think I'm going to go ahead and take one final side trip (for now) and finish the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/43963">Ender Quintet</a> before getting back to my list with <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12953520-year-zero">Year Zero</a>. Onwards!
