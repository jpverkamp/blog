Next up: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/45262-the-kingkiller-chronicle">The Kingkiller Chronicle</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/108424.Patrick_Rothfuss">Patrick Rothfuss</a>. It comes extremely highly recommended by a lot of people, so I figure that I was going to have to read it at some point.

Honestly, my response to it is conflicted. On one hand, it's an interesting fantasy world with a lot of rich world building and very solid writing (mechanically). On the other hand, the first book is huge, the second is time and a half as large... And it feels at times like nothing overarchiving happens. Plenty of small things happen, but they each feel like several small novels (if not short stories) stuck together end to end. I'm still not sure what I think about that.

I've heard rather good things about this book, so figured I had to read it.

On the good end, it's an interesting fantasy world with something of its own take on worldbuilding, magic, and critters (near enough to various sources, but it still fresh to me). I particularly like how magic works. There are parts of it which are well understood by those who study such things and work more or less like technology. Then there are the truly fantastical bits, used by few and understood by fewer--but still with a hint of structure under it. I like it.

Another positive was how the story kept pulling you along. I wanted to know more about how the world worked and how Kvothe would get himself out of whatever trouble he had gotten into next. I wanted to know how a particular story actually happened, before it changed hands a thousand times or more.

The negative half of that though? Cliffhangers. I swear half the chapters in this book ended in the middle of a thought, only to either be resolved at the very beginning of the next chapter or put off until after an interlude. So far as I'm concerned, it's a way to keep me reading, but an annoying one.

And then there's Kvothe. Sigh. He's too good at just about everything that he puts his mind to. Youngest to do this, best at that, perfect this, etc. Even if it gets him into trouble more often than not, it's still annoying to try to read about.

After that, there wasn't much depth to any of the other characters. I can only really tell apart two of the masters (Elodin and the one in charge of the Archives) and of his friends and acquaintances? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ D*nn* is supposed to be the best ever, but we never learn enough about her to care. Fela had hints of personality, but of course Kvothe doesn't care about that. Heck, Ambrose has the most personality of most of them and that's just to say he's anti-Kvothe.

Last but not least, the plot.

There wasn't one.

When things that could tangentially be described as plot finally started happening, I was surprised to find myself already 3/4 of the way through the book. And they never really went anywhere. I'm sure we'll eventually get some answers in a sequel... But if even a thousand page story cannot stand by itself...

All that said, I enjoyed it. I'll even read the sequel.

I'm hoping to get some answers... but I wouldn't bet on it.

And here I thought The Name of the Wind was a long book.

For the most part, everything that I wrote in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1411402558">my review of Name of the Wind</a> still holds true here. The worldbuilding is really cool (sygaldry in particular) and the writing itself just keeps pulling you along. I always wanted to know more.

On the other hand, The Wise Man's Fear is even worse about feeling like Rothfuss basically wrote several novels and basically stuck them together. You have Kvothe at the University, Kvothe and the Maer, Kvothe Hunts Bandits, Kvothe and the Fae, and Kvothe with the Adem. Each would have been a solid book by itself, and each actually has something of a traditional plot to it (with more solid conclusions than book as a whole had). But put them together and it just starts to feel like something of a slog.

I still don't overly care for Kvothe as a character. He's just too good at absolutely everything to be overly believable while at the same time being remarkably stupid a good part of the time. Each time he does something like that, I have to remind myself that he's only supposed to be a teenager and that actually makes sense... Which would be better if he acted like it the rest of the time. For a while there, I was hopeful that D*n* would realize she could do so much better... Alas.

So it goes.

I still enjoyed it and I'm still glad I read it. I've already started The Slow Regard of Silent Things and I'll certainly read Kingkiller #3 whenever it comes out.

<strong>Author's Foreward</strong>:

<em>You might not want to buy this book.</em> ...

Yeah... I thought we were going to get a little more insight into the world of the Kingkiller Chronicles. A little more about the University. A little more about Auri.

I guess one out of three ain't bad?

Basically, it's Auri being strange and re-arranging junk. Also there's a riveting scene of <spoiler>Auri making soap</spoiler>.

On the more positive side, there is some rather beautiful wordplay here. That's one thing that Rothfuss can do particularly well: wrote evocative descriptions.

Honestly, I found the Endnote the most interesting. A star just for that. It's always interesting to see into the mind of a writer. I didn't find the story itself <em>"disconcerting, off-putting, or confusing"</em> but rather odd and boring. So it goes. It <em>probably just wasn't for [me]</em>.

<strong>Author's Endnote</strong>:

... <em>If you're one of the peopel who found this story disconcerting, off-putting, or confusing, I apologize. The truth is, it probably just wasn't for you. The good news is that there are many other stories out there that are written for you. Stories that you will enjoy much more.</em>

<em>This story is for all the slightly broken people out there.</em>

<em>I am one of you. You are not alone. You are all beautiful to me.</em>

Next up, I'm going to be reading the unpublished novel White Sands by Brandon Sanderson (if you want to read it, it never hurts to ask...@footnote{Ask Sanderson, not me}). Since it's unpublished, I probably won't post a review of it. After that will be the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/86731-nexus">Nexus</a> series by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/160069.Ramez_Naam">Ramez Naam</a>.
