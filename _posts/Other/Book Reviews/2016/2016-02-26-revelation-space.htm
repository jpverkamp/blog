<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89187.Revelation_Space">Revelation Space</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/51204.Alastair_Reynolds">Alastair Reynolds</a>.

I'm a bit conflicted on this one. As you'll see in the individual reviews below, I enjoyed Revelation Space (the first book in the trilogy) and Chasm City (the same universe but only a tangentially related storyline), but I just couldn't get into the second of the trilogy: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89190.Redemption_Ark">Redemption Ark</a>. After reading about half of it over the course of a month (which is <em>far</em> longer than it normally takes me to read a book), I'm about ready to try something else. Perhaps I'll give it another try one day.

Nice bit of science fiction to kick off the new year.

Where Revelation Space really shines is showing a future that humanity might just see if we take several of the trends in current technology and thoughts that futurists hold about how the world might entail and dial them up even further.

We don't have a way to go faster than that the speed of light... But that's okay, since we've figured out a combination of long periods asleep and genetic/cybornetic alterations so that spacefarers don't seem to mind. This leads to some interesting thoughts on how two worlds might only get snippets of history between one another and then only when the few relativistic starships pass through, with crews that may not even count as human any more. The AIs are especially interesting, even if they're only tangential to the story, bringing up the problems that having a person-turned-copyable-computer-program might just cause.

There's also an interesting (spoiler laden) solution to the Fermi Paradox in there, although it took a while for everything to come together. Of everything that most makes me want to read the sequels to see if Reynolds builds on that any.

The plot was decent enough, although there were a few 'gotcha' moments towards the end that I wasn't entirely sure the story deserved. I like a mystery as much as the next person, but I like it best when the reader has a chance ahead of time to figure out what is going on.

The characters didn't feel entirely complete at times--although some of that might come from the unhuman nature of a good number of them.

All together, I liked it. It took far longer to read than most books I've read over the past year, but I think a large part of that wasn't due to the book. We'll give the sequel a try and see if it goes a bit quicker.

Chasm City takes a bit of a step sideways from Revelation Space, which on more reading makes perfect sense. It's not a sequel but rather a novel set in the same universe, a bit earlier in the timeline.

From the worldbuilding perspective, this extends and deepens what came earlier in Revelation Space, in particularly giving us a few insights into how early colonies could have been created in a universe without faster than light travel, the origins of the Melding Plague, and more backstory about Chasm City. All around, a very interesting world. It's a relatively grim possible future, but a well imagined one.

So far as plot goes, the story is relatively complicated, with at least timelines mixing together: a fleet of generation ships from Earth crossing between the stars, a hunting party on the war torn world they eventually settled on, and a quarry chased into the strange, plague ravaged world of Chasm City. Especially towards the end, it starts to get a little blurry exactly what is going on, but that's part of the draw of the story's climax. It's an <i>unreliable narrator</i> taken to an interesting extreme.

Overall, I enjoyed it. I'm not sure if I should have read Redemption Ark next or if it's not particularly relevant, but either way I liked the extra depth that Chasm City brings to its universe.

As mentioned above, I haven't actually finished this book yet.

What we have thus far is interesting, getting more into the encroaching threat that first came about through the latter half of Revelation Space. We also get tiebacks to the starship <em>Nostalgia for Infinity</em> and finally get to learn exactly why they have such a terrifying array of weapons... or at least where they came from.

Also, a lot of this story talks about a war spanning large swatches of humanity--which is fascinating when you take into account how long it takes to do anything on an interstellar scale without faster than light travel. One side of the conflict--the Conjoiners, or spiders as they are colloquially known--are particularly interesting. With cybernetic implants and early hints of a hive mind... There is a lot of interesting space to explore there.

I'm not entirely sure what's preventing me from finishing the book. It could be pacing; it could be characters; but nothing in particular is jumping to mind. It could just not be the book I'm looking for right now. As I mentioned before, perhaps I'll come back to it some day.

Next up on the physical book front, I'm reading book 8 of the @crosslink{The Iron Druid Chronicles}: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25337294-staked">Staked</a>. This will be a first for me, reading a new book in a series I've already reviewed. I'm not sure if I'll put up a new post or just update what I've done before. I guess we'll see when I've finished it. :smile:
