Three days left in 2015 and I realized I had finished everything on my original @crosslink{2015 Reading List}, there were only 3 days left in the year, and I had two books left to read so I needed a quick read. After @crosslink{Necroscope}, I also needed something a bit lighter.

<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8347.Garth_Nix">Garth Nix</a>'s' <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/42967-the-keys-to-the-kingdom">The Keys to the Kingdom</a> series fills both of those needs.

<!--more-->

The basic idea is that the Creator of the Universe has left the building--literally. They left behind a Will, but the seven Trustees in charge of seeing it done choose not to. One of these bits of sentient Will chooses a random pre-teen (or is he 13? it's unclear) to be the Heir to the Kingdom/House, by way of making him fight each of the seven Trustees in turn.

It's a weird world, but fun to read. There are a few interesting thoughts in there and plenty of quick, kid friendly (mostly) action.

Individual reviews (spoilers):

I'm pretty sure that Arthur died. He had a massive asthma attack, and, as his oxygen starved brain struggled its last, he hallucinated all of the rest. How else do you describe just how ... odd this book is.

That being said, I liked it. It's weird. Garth Nix really does his Proper Nouns. Everything felt like it Meant Something, although we never quite got a perfect idea what Anything was. Most of them were close enough though; so it goes. It's quick and the action picks you up and pulls you right through the story. When it's over, there's something of a feel of getting off a roller coaster, but in a good way.

Final thoughts: Is this series really going to take place over a week (Earth time)? All righty then.

Let's do it.

Of course they're all going to take place over a week (Earth time)...

There's really not much different between Mister Monday and Grim Tuesday. Arthur is starting to accept his fate while at the same time learning more about the rules of the House. It interesting to see him change even in just the first two books thus far.

It's nice to see a bit more of Suzy and also a bit more of the House. I see how they're going to have a different setting and antagonist each day, with an overarching world to tie them together. It's a neat idea and I want to see it all of the way through.

Also, apparently the Morrow Days are the 7 Deadly Sins? Was that ever explicitly mentioned?  Sloth and Greed down, 5 to go.

The world of the Keys to the Kingdom continues to get more interesting and weirder all at once. This time around, we have a sort of Multiversal Ocean and the Morrow Day that governs it. It's an interesting world all itself, with ships that were once other things, uplifted rats, and a very Nix'ian version of the Jonah and Whale story.

It's neat to finally see one of the Morrow Days that actually wants to help. I'm guessing we won't see much of that with the other half.

Also, oh snap that cliff hanger at the end. These really are seven parts of a seven part serialized novel. Nothing wrong with that though. It's an interesting style. I wonder if Nix wrote all seven of them before publishing?

Not much to say. Onwards and upwards for Arthur, taking on another of the Trustees and gaining another of the Keys.

Pretty much all of the problems in this book seemed overly easy to subdue, the Skinless Boy and Sir Thursday included. I think this has been going on for all of the rest of the books, but it seemed even more obvious in this one. Perhaps it's a factor of how relatively short they are?

Although on the flip side, setting things up with <spoiler>the Piper</spoiler> was interesting. I expected him to show up at some point, but this was a little different.

Also Dame Primus is totally going to be a problem. Called it here.

It's interesting throughout the whole series, Nix has managed to combine a relatively formulaic story with new twists and weird new worlds in each and every book.

The House just keeps getting weirder. I'm not sure how it's even really a 'House' at all. I think originally it was going to be and the Tuesday and Wednesday happened...

We don't actually see much of Lady Friday; the least of any thus far. So it goes.

It's interesting to see Arthur finally accept that he's going to finish this and, to do that, he has to use the Keys. Given how narrow a margin he was on before, I was curious how long that would take.

The Will is going to be a problem...

Five down, two to go.

I like the visuals around Saturday's realm. It's one of the better ones when it comes to motivation and the idea of a gigantic clockwork tower stretching upwards... cool.

On the other hand, we saw even less of Saturday than we did of Friday, which is saying something. I think she and Arthur were in the same scene for maybe a half dozen paragraphs? It's a bit weird. I assume we'll see more of her in the next book, but it's something of a departure.

Back on Earth, things continue to escalate. Did Nix really <spoiler>drop a nuke on the city?</spoiler> Looks like. It's an interesting move. I'm betting time travel shenanigans will be involved in the finale.

Speaking of the finale, the Will still hasn't caused nearly as much trouble as I expected. It keeps building up and then... nothing. At least nothing big. Another for Sunday I guess.

Overall, everything I was hoping for in an ending to the series.

We get to see a lot of Sunday and Sunday's realm: the Incomparable Gardens. It makes as much sense as anything in the rest of the House, so just go with it.

There's a lot of action, more than any previous book.

It's nice to see a bit more development in Leaf and Suzy.

The ending was... weird. Given the rest of the series, perhaps I shouldn't be surprised.

It's not the best thing I read in 2015 (although it currently does hold that title for 2016), but it's still pretty good. I'm glad I got a chance to fit it in.
