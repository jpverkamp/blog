It's been a while, but I've finally finished the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/86731-nexus">Nexus</a> series by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/160069.Ramez_Naam">Ramez Naam</a>. Near future sci-fi / thriller, they're great reads with some interesting technology and social/psychological repercussions therefrom. It's also combined with rather a lot of action, especially in the first two books.

Overall, they're a bit long and start to drag at time (too much action, who would have thought?). They're still worth reading.

It's been a while since I've read near future science fiction that wasn't overly apocalyptic. This was a good re-introduction thereto.

Basically, we're a few decades in the future. Genemods and other biotechnology are known and not entirely uncommon. I'm not sure such technology will actually be available in only 25 years, but it would be interesting to live in a world where such things have come to be.

The technology at the core of the story is Nexus: a nanotech drug that allows brain to brain communication. Even further, the main character has figured out how to run an OS on it. You're basically installing a new OS and code directly on your brain. That sounds at once really cool and terrifying to me. Especially since I do believe that this is in our future, whether or not it comes about via something like Nexus. It's only a matter of time.

Beyond that, I found the characters in general interesting. Seeing Kaden Lane's thought process as he came up against radically different government philosophies and ended up in situations well out of his depth was interesting. <spoiler>Su-Yong Shu as an early posthuman seemed at once just human and alien enough to be believable.</spoiler>

As both a positive and negative, there are a lot of frantic action scenes, particularly in the latter half of the book. They're well written and driving but got right on the edge of action fatigue by the end.

Overall, great book. Among the best cyberpunkish / near future sci fi I've ever read. Big world building cliff hanger right at the end. Definitely going to read the sequel(s).

Crux basically picks up where Nexus let off.

Nexus is a force in the world, with more than a million people using it, growing every day. One particularly interesting use is giving Nexus to children with autism to allow them to communicate directly mind to mind. Another is the children that were born to parents using Nexus. Interesting in both cases.

On the negative side, there have already been cases of people using Nexus for more nefarious purposes. Rape. Blackmail. Assassination. Like any new technology, there is the potential for much to go wrong. Something this big? Of course it does.

But where it really starts getting terrifying is when you consider the parallels with what Snowden revealed a few years ago and the current election cycle. The United States government (among others) in the world of Nexus has made such transhuman technology a crime. They are detaining those same children born with Nexus. One of the main storylines of Crux is just how deep such a hidden agenda might go. It's well written.

One note from a structural standpoint is that there is quite a lot of action in this book. It gets to the point where the action itself starts to drag. It could really use a few more breathers. It's certainly not a dealbreaker, but I think Nexus did it better.

All together, an excellent book. I look forward to the conclusion.

Final note: Feng is my favorite. He's hilarious.

A solid conclusion to the Nexus trilogy. Some things go exactly as I expected them to, but there are still a fair few surprises thrown in for good measure. For the most part, a lot of loose ends are tied up, making it a good way to end a series.

The stakes go up with most of the world in turmoil, the US and China in particular. The Chinese part was interesting (particularly since I've spent some time studying how the Chinese censorship systems work in the modern day), but felt tonally rather different from the previous books. It vaguely fits, but it felt almost like half a sequel and half something entirely new.

Speaking of a different focus, this book does turn a bit of the focus away from Nexus towards the post-human thoughts. Shu in particular. That particular storyline had already come about in the second book, but it really comes to the fore here. Again, it feels like the general story was drifting a bit, even if the drifting was interesting.

Overall, I think this Apex is weaker than Nexus and about as strong as the middle book. Apex is crazy huge and drags at time, but by this point I've invested enough time that I really want to see it through. I'm glad I did.

Random side note: The blurb says "<i>They call them the Apex - humanity's replacement.</i>". Did they actually mention this term at all in this book? I don't remember that overmuch.

Solid sci fi. Next up I have a nice standalone novel@footnote{For now. A sequel is due out... eventually}: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/38550.Brandon_Sanderson">Brandon Sanderson's</a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1268479.Warbreaker">Warbreaker</a>. It'll be interesting reading this intermixed with listening to Sanderson's Mistborn. So far, I think they're different enough that it shouldn't be a problem. We'll see.
