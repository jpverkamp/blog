Series number five: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/45135-alpha-omega">Alpha &amp; Omega</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/40563.Patricia_Briggs">Patricia Briggs</a>.

It's not that often I actually read two books/series in the same genre back to back. But after @crosslink{The Iron Druid Chronicles} last time and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/54966-white-trash-zombie">White Trash Zombie</a> up next, we've got something of an interesting contrast.

Back to Alpha &amp; Omega. I'd previously read the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/40932-mercy-thompson">Mercy Thompson</a> series, set in the same universe. It is a really interesting world in which a subset of the supernatural critters (only the fae at the start of the series) are 'out' in the public consciousness. Since the story is told from the perspective of various supernaturals and takes place primarily in their world, Briggs manages to avoid some of the problems that would come with such a revelation.

After reading both Alpha &amp; Omega and Mercy Thompson, I'm really hard pressed to say which series I like more. There's a certain familiarity and depth to Mercy, being the older (for me) and longer series, but Alpha &amp; Omega is the new shiny. It's nice to see a contrast between the mostly outsider perspective into the lives of werewolves that Mercy brings versus a wolf's look from Anna.

The fantastic elements to this story are well thought out, with a particularly interesting amount of attention paid to the relative dominance of werewolves and how that influences their ranks within the pack. Although it turns out that the original studies about alpha wolves aren't actually that great@footnote{<a href="http://io9.com/why-everything-you-know-about-wolf-packs-is-wrong-502754629">http://io9.com/why-everything-you-know-about-wolf-packs-is-wrong-502754629</a>}, it's still an interesting aspect for the story.

In addition to the wolves, you get the normal rogues gallery common in most urban fantasy. It turns out every story about things that go bump in the night is true. Vampires? Fae? Witches? Present and accounted for. It was particularly interesting reading the last book in Alpha &amp; Omega after reading @crosslink{The Iron Druid Chronicles} and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/40346-the-dresden-files">The Dresden Files</a>. There's a bit more influence from / reference to Navajo myths and it's interesting to see how each series does it differently.

One note, for better or for worse. Alpha &amp; Omega deals a lot more with themes of helplessness and rape (although Mercy had some as well). It was at times uncomfortable even for me; I can't really imagine how it would read to someone that had to live through such things.

Overall, Alpha &amp; Omega is an excellent series, easily my favorite out of the ones I've read thus far this year. I still couldn't say if I would recommend it over Mercy Thompson or vice versa. Honestly, if you have the time, read both. The timelines are intermixed (with some mostly small references between them), so you could even read alternating books.

So far this year, that puts me at 24 books out of 100 after two and a half months. I've fallen behind a bit (only 5 books ahead of schedule instead of 7), but still well on my way.

Up next: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/54966-white-trash-zombie">White Trash Zombie</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/852078.Diana_Rowland">Diana Rowland</a>.
