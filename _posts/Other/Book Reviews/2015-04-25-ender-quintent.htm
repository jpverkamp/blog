As mentioned in my post on @crosslink{The First Formic War}, I decided to take a quick detour from my @crosslink{2015 Reading List} and read the rest of the Ender Quintet. Since I've already read Ender's Game and @crosslink{Ender in Exile}, this just consisted of re-reading three novels: Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, and Children of the Mind.

My first thought in re-reading these books? Wow, those got weird. I'd forgotten how philosophical they get. There are hints of the same in most of Card's works, especially as you get to some of his more recent writings. The first of the three--Speaker for the Dead--is relatively straight forward through most of it. The pequeninos are a neat concept for an alien race (give Card credit for that, each of the species in the Enderverse actually manages to feel alien) and the story is relatively straight forward. It actually makes some sort of sense that--after having skipped through three thousand years of history--Ender would be drawn right to the next aliens. A chance for forgiveness for his sins of all those years ago.

Once you get past that into the other two books though--that's when things get weird. Don't get me wrong. I actually like the discussions about ai√∫a. It's in the interesting category of fiction which makes me think what if... what if that's how the world actually did work? Would that be so bad? It does drag on at times, but it's still an interesting concept.

Then there's the change in focus, bringing in the world of Path in Xenocide and then both Divine Wind and Pacifica in Children of the Mind. If it were any other books, I think hat I would have liked to see how he built up the cultures, so different from anything I personally have much experience with. But in the context of Speaker for the Dead--it just feels off. Like there are two completely separate stories going on that got smooshed together at some point.

All together though, I still do greatly enjoy all five books in the Ender Quintet, each for different reasons. Ender's Game is near the top of my personal science fiction list with Speaker for the Dead as a worthwhile successor. Xenocide and Children of the Dead are a little lower, but interesting to read if you want a bit of a different philosophy for a little while. I have less of a history with Ender in Exile, but it's a good follow up to the others, just a little less deep--which sometimes is a good thing.

Next up, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12953520-year-zero">Year Zero</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6423803.Rob_Reid">Rob Reid</a>. From what I've read about it, I remain cautiously optimistic. The premise sounds fascinating (aliens were pirating our music for decades and just now realize that--by our laws--they own more money than there is in the universe). Conversely though, it's been compared to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Perhaps it's blasphemy, but that just wasn't my cup of tea when I last read it. We'll see how it goes.
