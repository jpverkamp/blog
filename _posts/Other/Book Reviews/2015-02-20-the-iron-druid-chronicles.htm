On to my fourth series this year: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/52837-the-iron-druid-chronicles">The Iron Druid Chronicles</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4414255.Kevin_Hearne">Kevin Hearne</a>.

First, let's start with the good parts:

I really like urban fantasy series and this is a fairly prototypical example there of. It's always interesting to see how an author marries the real world with various mythologies. In particular, this series forcuses on Irish mythology, which is something that I haven't really had that much experience with.

Another thing I liked is how many/all of various religious figures are represented. It gets a little crazy at times, seeing how various aspects of all the different world religious figures are all all out and about but it's fun to see them interact. I was particularly amused when Mary (yup, that Mary) showed up. That's not something I've often seen.

Finally, the books are really funny. Some of the humor was more than a little crude. I particularly enjoyed a lot of the mental back and forth between Atticus and his hound. While I agree with a lot of other reviews I've read about the series in that the latter doesn't actually feel like a dog, but that's not really the point. The point is that he's funny. :smile:

Okay, now the less than great parts:

Atticus is supposed to be 2,100 years old. He really doesn't feel it. He claims that he's gotten very good at fitting in with modern young adults, but there's never really a sense of age or weight to him. He comments on all manner of events that he's been involved in, but there's really nothing to it other than those slight mentions.

How in the world have none of the mortal gods died by the beginning of the series? In the very first book, it becomes all too obvious that gods can be killed. But we're supposed to believe that pretty much all of them have survived for millenia until Atticus happens to come around? All righty then.

There is a tendency towards a male fantasy centric / sexist view, especially in the earlier books. I'd be willing to be that the author got more than a few reviews and comments about this and it is toned down somewhat by the latter books. Still, the idea of random goddesses and other woman seemingly ranodmly falling for the main character and the sidekick dog's obsession with poodles are offputting.

All that being said, there's an obvious comparison (at least in my mind) between this series and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/40346-the-dresden-files">The Dresden Files</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10746.Jim_Butcher">. They both have a male-fantasy-powerful male protagonist; they both rely heavily on a quick moving snarky sense of humor. Iron Druid starts out at a higher level, although the latter Dresden Books do catch up rather well. All together, if you're only going to read one of them read The Dresden Files. But if you run out of Dresden Files, you could do worse than The Iron Druid Chronicles.

So far this year, that puts me at 20 books out of 100 after 51 days; 7 books ahead of schedule. I guess that's another indicator for how much I wanted to keep reading the Iron Druid Chronicles.

Up next, more urban fantasy! <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/45135-alpha-omega">Alpha &amp; Omega</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/40563.Patricia_Briggs">Patricia Briggs</a>.
