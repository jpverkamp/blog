Series number six: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/show/54966-white-trash-zombie">White Trash Zombie</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/852078.Diana_Rowland">Diana Rowland</a>.

Continuing on my recent trend, here is the third urban fantasy novel series in a row. After @crosslink{The Iron Druid Chronicles} and @crosslink{Alpha and Omega}, it's actually a breath of fresh air to see a series that doesn't take the everything-is-real approach and make a world where only one thing is different: zombies.

<!--more-->

On one hand, it's particularly interesting to see a zombie main character. Far more often than not, the zombies are the bad guys. Only rarely are they even particularly intelligent, let alone much more than evil monsters. Here, they're just like everyone else--just so long as they get a nice supply of brains. With brains, they not only remain human, but can actually push harder and faster.

The underlying means of how zombies work is pretty neat. Essentially, zombies have a brain based symbiote interested primarily in brains, but also in helping their host surive. It's for exactly that reason that zombies without brains begin to rot--the symbiote is forcing the host to choose their priorities. There's an interesting aspect that I wish the series got into more--once the symbiote has taken hold, how much influence does it have? How much has the person changed? @wikipedia["Ship of Theseus"]{Are they still the same person?}

One core theme throughout the book is how exactly do zombies get their brains (the main character ends up with a job at the local morgue). Killing people for their brains is rare enough--but not entirely ignored, bringing a bit of internal conflict. Another amusing note is how they eat them.

Another theme is the 'white trash' part of White Trash Zombie. If you read enough urban fantasy series, you tend to start seeing a lot of similarity between the main characters. It's not really that bad, since it's one of the reasons many people read them in the first place, but it's still nice to see something different. Particularly since there's a lot of room for growth. There's a lovely progression through the series as the main character gets her life together--sometimes by force, most drugs just don't work on zombies--all without completely abandoning her roots.

One oddity I found in reading all four books together is that the forth doesn't really fit with the first three. There's an increase in scale for each book, but it seems to me that the first fit together much better than the forth. It's interesting to see how the titular 'white trash' zombie deals with traveling a thousand miles further than she ever has in her life, but her sudden ascention to power seems a bit odd. So it goes, it's still an enjoyable story. Plus it brings an interesting wrinkle to how zombies work that I really want to see how they work out. Luckily a fifth book is in the pipeline.

All together, the White Trash Zombie series was a nice breath of fresh air. (Amusing that.) Still urban fantasy, but a much different approach. 28 books down, we're just over a quarter done bookwise with the year, and with a few days left in the quarter to boot. Awesome.

Up next, I have <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12779838-precinct-13">Precinct 13</a>, yet another kitchen sink urban fantasy. Should be fun, although at this point, I'm glad it's only a single book. Then we try some science fiction instead for a while.
