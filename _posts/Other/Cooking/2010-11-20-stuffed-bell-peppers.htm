Well, I think you'd get something like this! We were planning on taking pictures throughout the process to show how we actually made, but things got a little chaotic, so we didn't. So it goes. You still get to see the final product. :)

(As a side note, the filling has tomato sauce, beef, mushrooms, onions, andÂ <em>more bell peppers</em>!) It's bell-pepper-ception!
