title: Homemade tortilla chips
---
We were in a frying sort of mood after @crosslink["corn-breaded-pickle-chips"]{yesterday's pickle chips}, so today we decided to make some homemade tortilla chips.

It's actually a really simple process:
<ul>
	<li>cut up a tortilla</li>
	<li>fry the pieces</li>
</ul>
<!--more-->

Who'da thunk?

I wish I'd gotten a few more pictures while we were still making them, but it turns out that they're too tasty. We were eating them faster than I could fry more. Really, we're lucky that we got even this shot.

If you ever have the time (and you don't need much) and spare tortillas, I really would suggest you try it. It's amazing to have chips and salsa, all homemade.
