Cooked something worth blogging about, if only because it's so easy.

<strong>Ingredients</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Ground beef (cooked and seasoned)</li>
    <li>3 small potatoes</li>
	<li>A dozen eggs</li>
	<li>An onion</li>
	<li>Cheese</li>
</ul>

<strong>Recipe</strong>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 425â„‰</li>
	<li>Slice the potatoes thinly (I used a food processor)</li>
	<li>Pre-cook the potatoes for 5 minutes in the microwave</li>
    <li>Spray a deep oven sheet</li>
    <li>Put down a layer of potatoes and onions, then the beef</li>
    <li>Pour eggs over the whole thing</li>
    <li>Bake for 10 minutes</li>
    <li>Slice and server</li>
</ol>

In progress, we have everything ready to go in the oven:

(Keen-eyed observers will note I may have forgotten the onions...)

And done / partially eaten:

It's really easy with only a couple minutes of prep and 15 minutes of waiting time. Nice for when you have only limited supplies and want a breakfasty dish.
