The insides are a nice mix of chicken, rice, tomatoes, and veggies while the outsides are pretty standard flour tortillas. Take the whole thing in a skillet with a bit of vegetable oil and fry it up. We could deep fry them, but I have neither a deep enough skillet nor that much oil. So it goes. frying one side at a time worked well enough though.
