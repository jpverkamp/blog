I finally finished off the last of my chili, so I figure it might be time enough to try out the slow cooker I got for Christmas. Starting with what I hoped would be a relatively simple recipe, I combined rice,Â broccoli, and chicken (with some chicken broth for a base) and let it go.

Basically it turned into a semi-congealed mass with a goo like texture. Still, it tasted decent. I think in the future I should perhaps actually follow a recipe from the slow cooker cookbook I have. Maybe.
