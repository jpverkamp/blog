title: Chicken and tomatoes
---
Today we have one of those simple recipes when you're short on prep time but still want something delicious.

You'll need:
<ul>
	<li>chicken</li>
	<li>rice</li>
	<li>tomatoes</li>
	<li>herbs and spices (we used basil and oregano)</li>
	<li>olive oil</li>
</ul>
<!--more-->

Basically, go ahead and start the rice. While that's cooking, just put everything down in layers in something bake-with-able.

Stick it in the oven and about twenty minutes later... bam. Chicken and tomatoes:

It's amazing how easy it is to cook sometimes. :)
