title: Cheesy chicken a la slow cooker
---
To continue our weekend of cooking, we tried a recipe from the slow cooker recipie book I got for Christmas (or maybe my birthday, I don't actually remember which): four ingredient cheesy chicken!<!--more-->

Of course we couldn't do things the simple way, so we added a few things and turned it into a pasta dish, but in the end it was the second actually successful slow cooker recipe we've made (we've never actually gotten anything with rice in it to work...)

<strong>Ingredients</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Chicken</li>
	<li>2 cans cream of chicken soup</li>
	<li>1 can cream of cheddar soup</li>
	<li>Garlic</li>
	<li>Onion<sup>†</sup></li>
	<li>Green pepper<sup>†</sup></li>
	<li>1 can of tomatoes<sup>†</sup></li>
	<li>Pasta<sup>†</sup></li>
</ul>
<sup>†</sup> ingredients that weren't in the original recipe

<strong>Recipe</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Cut up the chicken and peppers</li>
	<li>Put everything in the slow cooker</li>
	<li>Cook for 6-8 hours</li>
	<li>Cook the pasta</li>
	<li>Add pasta to slow cooker</li>
	<li>Enjoy :smile:</li>
</ol>
So how did the process go?

Here we have the contents of the slow cooker before it actually started to cook. I'm not going to lie--it looks pretty disgusting at this point. I'm not really a fan of cream of whatever soups, they just have such a strange (lack of) texture. I guess they do really add to a lot of dishes when cooked into them though, we've used them before. I did spend a bit of time layering things so that it all cooked together without intervention, but I'm not completely sure it was necessary. It certainly shouldn't hurt though.

And here's a shot of the final product. It was amazing. The chicken just sort of fell apart at the slightest touch (this would be a great way to make shredded chicken for burritos or the like) and the cheesy tomatoey goodness permeated the entire dish. Even better, there was plenty left over. Enough for a few meals at least.

I think the best part was that there was very little prep time. I really do enjoy cooking, but it does tend to stretch to an hour or two per meal when all things are considered. For this, we probably needed about 15 minutes of prep time then we just dumped everything in the pot and waited for six hours. It took a bit longer at the end to make the pasta, but pasta is quick and easy enough. Then it was time to eat. That's kind of nice. We'll have to check out a few more recipes from that book in the future!
