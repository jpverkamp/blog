Next, you cook them for a while (see above). The nice bit is that once you've cooked them, the skin comes right off. That is glorious, since it's so much easier to peel than with a knife.

Next, mix everything except the spices into the pumpkin puree:

And now mix in the spices. The spices really make the pie:
