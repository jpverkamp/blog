title: Chili a la wok
---
One of my favorite dishes to make is a sort of chili. Since I don't really have a strict recipe, it tends to vary wildly, but it's always tasty and usually can feed me for a solid week.

As a rough outline, my "chili" usually contains:
<ul>
	<li>some sort of meat (I've used ground beef, ground turkey, and chicken breast before)</li>
	<li>vegetables (green peppers and onions at they very least)</li>
	<li>starches (pasta, rice, and/or potatoes; I usually have at least two of these)</li>
	<li>beans</li>
	<li>tomatoes (canned, fresh, or tomato sauce; sometimes more than one)</li>
</ul>
<!--more-->

Making it is even easier. Brown the meat while cooking the pasta/rice on the side, mix the onions with the meat, mix in the rest of non-liquids / non-starches, and then finally dump everything in a larger container (like my awesome cast iron wok) to simmer for a while.

It's enough to fill up two of the large Tupperware containers that I have, each of which holds 6-8 bowls worth--like I said, a week easy. And it's tasty enough that I can usually make the entire week without getting sick of it. :smile:
