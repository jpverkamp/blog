Oof. So what do these two actually have in common again? I can feel a bit of the pain that they're going through doing the PhD dance myself, but the extent they take it to just seems a bit extensive. If you can't talk about things, then move on--particularly before spending five years growing a(n admittedly pretty awesome) beard and making just about everything out of local wildlife.

Then it just keeps dragging on until that final bit when Tom takes his food truck to where Violet was going (heck, I thought of that solution right at the very beginning...) and they finally end up getting married. Yay romantic comedies?

Perhaps it's just not my sort of movie, but that still doesn't stop me from putting it at the bottom of my list thus far. Some romantic comedies I actually like. This wasn't one of them.
