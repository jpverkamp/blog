Out of all the pre-Avengers / @wikipedia["List_of_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe_films#Phase_One:_Avengers_Assembled"]{Phase One} Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, it's really a toss up whether Iron Man or Captain American was my favorite. In @wikipedia["List_of_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe_films#Phase_Two"]{Phase Two}? It's not even a question@footnote{At least unless Guardians of the Galaxy manages to realy surprise us all. Still, I'm not sure if that one quite counts.}. Captain America: The Winter Soldier.

It's really quite amazing watching the creative minds behind the Marvel Cinematic Universe work. Again and again, I keep expecting them to overreach themselves. I keep waiting for this huge empire they've built to come tumbling down@footnote{Somewhat like SHIELD...}. Well... not this time. Not by a long shot. 

All in all, this was a solid addition. It contrasts nicely with the first Captain American film, showing what happens when you take blind patriotism and trust in a massive central authority and turn it to the darker side. It's interesting to see how the Cap, Fury, and Black Widow each deal with it in their own ways. 

And then there's the eponymous Winter Soldier. I really felt like they could have done a lot more with him. I know that there's a lot of potential there from the comics, even going so far as maybe having him eventually take up Cap's shield some day@footnote{If I understand correctly, @wikipedia{Sebastian Stan} is actually under contract for more films than @wikipedia{Chris Evans}, although who knows what exactly that means.}.

One last bit that's particularly cool is the idea of what this will to @wikipedia{Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.}. I haven't watched the newest episode where presumably they deal with all this fall out, but I bet it's going to get all sorts of interesting in a hurry. I don't know if there's ever been such a relationship between a series of films and another on TV, but it's really interesting to see how it all plays out. 

Unfortunately, this is only the third movie I've seen this year. An honestly, as good as it was, I would be ever so slightly to go see The Lego Movie again (that song is <em>just so *catchy*</em>). Still, a solid #2, and it might as well be a toss up with #1.
