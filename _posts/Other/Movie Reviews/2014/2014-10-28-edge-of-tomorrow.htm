Disclaimer time: I have a full time job now. And a baby at home. Some combination of these things means that I have nowhere near as much time to go see movies as I once did. So it goes.

But rather than let this particular part of my blog go to waste, I think that I'll go ahead and keep writing up movies. Just instead of movies in theaters, I'll aim for new releases on DVD / VOD.

Why?

Edge of Tomorrow.

<!--more-->

Edge of Tomorrow (aka Live Die Repeat@footnote{Who thought a name change for the DVD release would be a good idea?}) is a surprisingly solid movie. Looking back, I would say that it's probably Tom Cruise's best film in more than a decade--heck, I might even put it above Minority Report, in which case I'd actually call it his best film ever.

The aliens are downright alien--and pretty cool looking--the effects are well done, and the Groundhog Day applied to war@footnote{Spoilers!} concent works out really well. But what really carried the movie were <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000129/?ref_=tt_cl_t1">Tom Cruise</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1289434/?ref_=tt_cl_t2">Emily Blunt</a>. Lovely performances.

If you're looking for a solid sci-fi action flick with a touch of what-if inducing thought behind the scenes, you could do far worse than Edge of Tomorrow. I really wish that I'd gotten a chance to see it in theaters. It seems like exactly the sort of movie that would benefit from the big screen treatment.
