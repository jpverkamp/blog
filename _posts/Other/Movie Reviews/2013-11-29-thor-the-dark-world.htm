The first Thor was a bit disappointing. 

There, I said it.

It could certainly have been worse, but it really felt like the entire movie served solely to set up Thor@footnote{And @wikipedia["Hawkeye (comics)"]{Hawkeye}}@footnote{And @wikipedia{Phil Coulson}} for the Avengers. It wasn't terrible, it just ... was.

Thor: The Dark world@footnote{What's with the colon'ated titles?} makes up for it. 

It takes Asgard and the nine realms in all their CGI mono-environmental glory@footnote{Seriously? An entire frozen world?} a step further. It shows that even if the Asgardians are gods, that doesn't mean that they're immortal@footnote{Although exactly what will kill them remains somewhat unclear.}. It brings a bit of the science-fantasy edge to the Marvel Universe, nicely contrasting with the science of Iron Man and Thor and the blind patriotism of Captain America. It's a neat world, and could probably even stand on it's own@footnote{Although the greater Marvel Cinematic Universe makes it all the better}. 

That's not to say that there weren't a few problems though.

Jane Foster (@wikipedia{Natalie Portman}) still doesn't make sense. They had <em>one</em> weekend together@footnote{Seriously. Thor takes place over three days.}, then didn't see each other for years. 

Then there was @wikipedia{Christopher Eccleston} as the big bad Malekith. He was just ... sort of there. Pretty much completely interchangeable. Sure, he can kick some Asguardian butt, but so can The Incredible Hulk. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Still. Pretty good. Pretty dang good. Of the Marvel Movies this year, I still liked Iron Man 3 better, but only just. They're both certainly worth a rewatching in a year and change when Avengers 2 comes out.
