... there's really not much to say about this that hasn't been said / won't be said a thousand times over. Long story short, it's a great movie and a hit out of the park for everyone involved. I liked it enough that I'm sure to see it again and I strongly suggest that you go to.

Then again, with the box office numbers already as high as they are, you probably already have. I guess you could go again. :smile:
