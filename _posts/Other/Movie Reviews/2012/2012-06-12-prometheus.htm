Huh. Well, the trailers were good. That's something at least.

<!--more-->

But when you're making a movie that's supposed to be science fiction, you should at least make sure the scientist characters act a bit like scientists.

A geologist with those neat mapping devices that gets lost in a cave?

A biologist that's afraid of dead body (which would otherwise be a once in a lifetime discovery) and then decides to randomly pet what's essentially a King Cobra?

A magic medical machine that somehow can only deal with male patients... in the quarters of a woman? Oh, and being able to run after getting stapled back together like that. Ug.

Meh. I think I'll just go back and watch the trailer again.
