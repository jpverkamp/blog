I think that if Brave where made by anyone other than Pixar, I would have absolutely loved it. Granted, that's not really a fair comparison, but I just can't shake the feeling.

Don't get me wrong, Pixar has had some pretty amazing movies (Toy Story, Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, and WALL-E in particular), but I just wasn't feeling it with Brave.

The parts about communication between parents and children were good, but I'm not 100% sure where they were going with the overall message. You can change your fate, but you have to learn to compromise and sacrifice your own wants for others.... Yeah, I'm not sure.

Also, they gave away pretty much all of the interesting parts of the plot in the trailers (never a good sign). And they hinted at a much more epic story/world with the whole "change your fate" thing that never really appeared.

Ah, who am I kidding. Even the worst of Pixar's movies (and this isn't even that) are a fair margin above average. It was a completely enjoyable way to spend a few hours. Overall, it lands in third, edging out Men in Black 3.
