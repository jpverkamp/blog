title: 'Board Game Review: Burrows'
---
I figure that we play enough board games that I might as well start reviewing them. Feel free to take anything I say with a grain of salt as my taste in games may not be your taste in games. Still, hopefully someone somewhere out there may find it useful. At the very least, it's a way to remind myself months down the road about games that I played myself. :smile:

In any case, the very first game that I have is a strange little game that we played at the <a title="Arsenal Game Room" href="http://arsenalgameroom.com/">Arsenal Game Room</a> in Indianapolis last Sunday. The name of the game is Burrows and the goal of the game is essentially to run a gopher farm that by the end of the game has collected the fewest overall complains. No, I'm really not kidding. Yet despite the strange feel and light look to the game, it's actually surprisingly deep and fun to play even with just two players (as we were).

When you open the box, there are piles upon piles of tiles, most of which are in the shape of 2x1 rectangles. In those rectangles, there are six entry points (two on each long side, one on each short side) that join together in a variety of ways. Basically, throughout the game, you're going to play them in an interlocking grid somewhat like dominoes, lining them up in every which way.

Another aspect of the game is the gophers. Depending on how many players you're playing with, there will be anywhere from one to about a dozen of the little guys starting out on the board, each in an initial den of a single tile long (actually on your score card, but that isn't terribly important). But--being gophers--they aren't content with those tiny dens so they're waiting for you to build larger ones. Anytime you complete a tunnel with the same color on each end, you have the chance that a gopher will move in. If you already have a gopher of that color and build them a longer tunnel, they'll just move over. On the other hand, if you don't have that gopher and your tunnel is at least as long as the shortest other player's tunnel, you'll steal <em>their </em>gopher. It might sound a little confusing, but it's really not so bad after only a round or two.

Then finally, there's the scoring mechanic. Some of the tiles have a little bus symbol on them that will advance a tour bus chock full of people itching to see your gophers. Every three or four advances (depending on the number of players), the tour bus will arrive and the masses will descend. Depending on another set of cards (you can see them to the right in the picture above), certain gophers are going to be in higher demand than others. If you don't have a particular color of gopher that the crowds want to see, you're going to get complains (1-3). And then at the end of the game.

The final bit that I wanted to mention is the draw mechanic. It's kind of neat in that it's not purely luck based but neither is it solely an individual strategy. What you have is essentially a shared hand that starts with two tiles revealed face up to each player. On your turn, you reveal a third tile and then pick one of the three to either store for later or play now. If you store a tile, you place it in front of you and your turn is done. Then on a later turn, you can play that tile in addition to whatever you would normally play for that turn. It turns out that there's actually a decent amount of strategy in planning ahead and stashing the more useful pieces as they come up.

Overall, I'd have to rate the game high enough that I'd personally play it again, but not quite high enough that I'll actually go out and buy a copy. I'll definitely check it out if/when I make it out to Arsenal with a larger group as I'm curious how different the 4/5 player dynamic is.
