I've just gone back through all of my older posts in the <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/category/small-projects/" title="Small Projects">Small Projects category</a> and uploaded most of the source code to <a href="https://github.com/jpverkamp" title="GitHub: jpverkamp">GitHub</a>. This will let me maintain the code on a local git repository and should make updating projects easier, rather than having to update them on my web server. 

Also, syntax highlighting! Everyone loves a good syntax highlighter.

In any case, you can access all of the code that I've posted thus far here:
