title: Ludum Dare 26 -- VTanks -- Results
---
The voting period for Ludum Dare 26 has ended, which means that now we have <a title="Ludum Dare 26 Results" href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2013/05/20/ludum-dare-26-results/">some results</a>! Before I post my own, take a moment to check out the overall leaders. Given that there were <em>2346</em> games submitted (1610 in the compo and 736 in the jam), there are bound to be some real gems in there.<!--more-->

Overall, I know that I can do better. But given that I only had about 6 hours to spend, I don't think I did half bad. I'm a bit amused that I somehow managed to place better than about half the entries on humor... given that there was no humor to speak of in the game. I guess getting yourself buried is funny?

Even weirder is audio. I came in at 38% audio... and I didn't have any. I'm pretty sure that the policy is just not to leave a score in a category if it doesn't make sense, in which case I wouldn't get a rating. So yeah... That's strange.

All that being said, it was a lot of fun to participate in Ludum Dare for once. After that, it was just about as much fun to play some of the games. It's <em>amazing</em> what some people put out in 24 hours. I'll have to do this again!

(If you'd like to play my entry, you can do so @crosslink["vtanks-for-ludum-dare-26"]{here}.)
