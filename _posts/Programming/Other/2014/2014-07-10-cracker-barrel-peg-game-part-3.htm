title: Cracker Barrel Peg Game, Part 3
---
If you were paying attention when I posted part 2 to GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/jpverkamp/small-projects/blob/master/blog/pegs.rkt">pegs.rkt</a>), you might have noticed a function I hadn't talked about: <code>play</code>

<!--more-->

With everything we've done over the past two posts, we have everything we need to actually play the peg game:

@codeblock["scheme"]|{
(define (play p)
  (cond
    [(= 1 (count p))         (displayln "YOU WIN!")]
    [(= 0 (length (next p))) (display "You lose. :(")]
    [else
     (render-text p)
     (displayln "Enter the peg to use and the peg to jump")
     (define from (read))
     (define over (read))
     (cond
       [(jump p from over) => play]
       [else 
        (displayln "Invalid move.")
        (play p)])]))
}|

Let's play!

@codeblock['racket]{> (play (invert (make-puzzle 1)))

You lose. :(}

Oops. 

Can you do any better? (Without using @crosslink["cracker-barrel-peg-game"]{part 1}?)
