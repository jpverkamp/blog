title: 'Project Euler #1'

<blockquote>
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

We start off relatively simple, just asked to sum up a thousand numbers. `for/sum` does exactly what we want, looking over all of the values and adding them up. The `#:when` clause does the rest, limiting it to just numbers divisible by 3 or 5. 

@codeblock["scheme"]|{
(define (sum-divisibles limit)
  (for/sum ([i (in-range 1 limit)]
            #:when (or (divides? i 3)
                       (divides? i 5)))
    i))

; test if n evenly divides m
(define (divides? m n)
  (= 0 (remainder m n)))
}|

@codeblock["scheme"]|{
> (time (sum-divisibles 1000))
cpu time: 0 real time: 1 gc time: 0
233168

Alternatively, this could be done using a bit of discrete mathematics. We have three arithmetic series of interest:

The sum of numbers divisible by 3:@latex|{ div_3 = 3 + 6 + ... + 999 = (\frac{999}{3})(\frac{3 + 999}{2}) = 166833 }|The sum of numbers divisible by 5:@latex|{ div_5 = 5 + 10 + ... + 995 = (\frac{995}{5})(\frac{5 + 995}{2}) = 99500 }|The sum of numbers divisible by 3 and 5. Since `lcm(3,5) = 15`, this is equivalent to the sum of numbers divisible by 15:@latex|{ div_15 = 15 + 30 + ... + 990 = (\frac{990}{15})(\frac{15 + 990}{2}) = 33165 }|All together, we need to add the numbers divisible by 3 and 5. Since the numbers divisible by 15 are counted in both, subtract one copy of those:@latex|{ div_3 + div_5 - div_15 = 166833 + 99500 - 33165 = 233168 }|And there you have it. The first of (hopefully) many posts on Project Euler.
