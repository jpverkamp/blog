This is both a completely straight forward problem and a nice way to learn about scanning through strings. 

In the Racket case, we'll want to use nested `for` loops. The outer loop will use `for/fold` to keep track of the best result so far. The inner loop will take an offset into the string and calculate the product. Assuming that the string `n` contains the number given in the problem:

@codeblock["scheme"]|{
(for/fold ([best 0])
          ([i (in-range (- (string-length n) 5))])
  (max best
       (for/product ([j (in-range 5)])
         (string->number (string (string-ref n (+ i j)))))))
}|

The code in the Python version is pretty much the same:

@codeblock["python"]|{
best = 0
for i in range(len(n) - 5):
    best = max(best, int(n[i + 0]) * 
                     int(n[i + 1]) * 
                     int(n[i + 2]) * 
                     int(n[i + 3]) * 
                     int(n[i + 4]))
print best
}|

If you want to get a bit fancy about it, you can take advantage of the `reduce` function to rewrite that code in a much more compact (albeit less readable fashion):

@codeblock["python"]|{
from operator import mul
print reduce(max, [reduce(mul, map(int, n[i:i+5]), 1) for i in range(len(n) - 5)], 0)
}|

If you work from the inside out:
<ul>
<li>`n[i:i+5]` will pull out five digits starting at `i` as a string</li>
<li>`map(int, n[i:i+5])` will convert that into a list of five actual integers</li>
<li>`reduce(operator.mul, ..., 1)` will basically combine that list into a single number using multiplication as the glue (`*` isn't a function in Python, ergo `operator.mul`)</li>
<li>`[reduce(...) for i in range(len(n) - 5)]` will generate all such products</li>
<li>`reduce(max, ..., 0)` will calculate the maximum of all of these numbers</li>
</ul>

Each of these versions will give you the expected value of 40824 (and all in less than a millisecond). None too shabby for a day's work.
