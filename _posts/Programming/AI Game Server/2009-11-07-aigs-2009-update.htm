New version uploaded.

Bug fixes:
<ul>
	<li>Fixed swapping players bug.</li>
	<li> Potential fix for not your turn bug (not sure if this one will work).</li>
	<li> Sending 'Unsolvable' as a move can be used to prematurely end a game (and will output the game log).</li>
	<li> Fixed/removed extra YourTurn packets sent on failed move.</li>
	<li> Fixed capturing, players can now capture correctly and wil respawn at their bases.</li>
	<li> Fixed returning flags.  Flags were returning at (0, 0), now the return to their spawn points.</li>
	<li> End of game now actually ends instead of looping with a winner (or Tie Game) returned.</li>
	<li> Removed extra print statements from server code (that were printing multiple slightly different states).</li>
</ul>
