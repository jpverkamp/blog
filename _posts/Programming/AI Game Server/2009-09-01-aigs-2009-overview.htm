Despite what I said last year, I started the AIGS over this year.  To shake things up a bit, I'm implementing this year's version with .NET in C# (the previous two years used Python and Java respectively).

This year, the game will be Capture the Flag.  Hopefully, we can have a more complex game without overdoing it and avoid the problems with low branching factor that we had last year with Hex.  Keep an eye on this spot for more updates.
