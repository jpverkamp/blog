title: AIGS 2009 Update
---
Initial upload of the server.  There was a pre-release version emailed to the class (that I no longer have), thus the 'updates.'

All versions of the server should run correctly with .NET installed in Windows or with Mono on Linux or OSX.  I've tested the Windows and Linux versions and both seem to work perfectly.

<strong>Updates</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Sequential games are possible.  You can not join two games at the same time, but once one game is complete you can join another.</li>
	<li> You can send "Unsolvable" as a move string (see CTFProtocol).  If you are correct, you win.  If you are incorrect, you lose.  I suggest that you are completely sure before you send this message.  ;D</li>
</ul>
