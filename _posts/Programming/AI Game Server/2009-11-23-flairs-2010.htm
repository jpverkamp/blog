The fall quarter has ended and thus so has the AIGS 2009 project.  Version 0.2.04 is the last version that I will (most likely) be updating.  I think that an independent study group will be working on the version for next year, and I wish them the best of luck.

On a brighter note, Prof. Wollowski and I have written a paper based on the AIGS project and have submitted it to FLAIRS 2010 (an AI conference in Florida).  This will potentially be my third published work in CS.  Hope it gets accepted!
