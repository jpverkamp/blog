Ok, so the new server is up.  I can almost guarantee that there are some problems (so goes the life of a CS), so go ahead and hammer away at it and see what you can do.

One major thing, the game string format has changed:<strong>
</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Players are represented by lower case letters from 'a' to 'j'</li>
	<li>Players carrying flags are represented by upper case letters from 'A' to 'J'</li>
	<li> Bases are represented by numbers '0' to '9'</li>
	<li>Players will immediately score if no bases are present but must return a flag to a base if one is present</li>
	<li> Players must step on flags to pick them up, but only must be adjacent to a base to drop it off</li>
	<li> Players can only carry one flag</li>
</ul>

<!--more-->

The new CTFScenario file contains 8 new scenarios involving bases, most with multiple players and/or flags.  The final few also have multiple bases and are rather complicated.
