<strong>Part 1:</strong> Given a string of `()` characters controlling a simulated elevator, where `(` means 'go up' and `)` means 'go down', what floor do you end up on?

<!--more-->

@codeblock["python"]|{
data = sys.stdin.read()
print(data.count('(') - data.count(')'))
}|

Basically, `count` the number of up, subtract the number of down. Nothing much more to say for this one.

<strong>Part 2:</strong> How far do you make it in the instructions before the current floor is negative?

@codeblock["python"]|{
floor = 0
for index, char in enumerate(sys.stdin.read()):
    floor += (1 if char == '(' else -1)
    if floor < 0:
        print(index)
        sys.exit(0)
}|

There might be a more elegant way to do this one, but this is clean enough so far as I'm concerned.
