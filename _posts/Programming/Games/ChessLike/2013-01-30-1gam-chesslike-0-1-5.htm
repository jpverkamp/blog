Back around the last <a title="LudumDare" href="http://www.ludumdare.com/">Ludum Dare</a>, I decided to try out <a title="One Game A Month" href="http://onegameamonth.com/">One Game A Month</a>. Basically, the goal is to write one complete game per month, every month in 2013. Of course I'm great at putting things off until the very last minute--I finally started yesterday. So it goes.

In any case, here's the current version of the game. I'm sure I'll be able to put a bit more into it today and tomorrow, but it's actually surprisingly playable. It really started coming together in the last few hours of work.

The idea is simple enough: you and up to three computer players will have a collection of chess pieces in a board. You'll each move your pieces in turn (all of them, not just the one), trying to capture all of the other player's pieces. If you do, you win. If you get eliminated first, you lose. That's it.

Pretty much the only difference so far as movements go is that the pawn doesn't only move forward (what would that even mean in this context?), but it still moves orthogonally and captures diagonally.

Other than that, try it out. If you have any feed back / constructive criticism, leave a comment below or email me at <a title="my email address" href="mailto:me@"@"jverkamp.com">me@"@"jverkamp.com</a>.
