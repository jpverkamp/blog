title: '#1GAM - ChessLike 0.2.0 - Dungeons!'
---
Here's another day's work on ChessLike. It's actually a bit less full featured than yesterday, but I've made a lot of progress towards the dungeon framework that I'm going for.

<!--more-->

Things that work:
<ul>
	<li>Level generation for the first two tiers of levels and the first tier of special levels</li>
	<li>Descending stairways connecting different levels</li>
	<li>Possible bonus stairways to reach special levels</li>
	<li>Loss condition (you have to keep your King alive)</li>
</ul>
Things that don't work yet:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 15px;">Third, fourth, and fifth tier levels; the second tier of special levels</span></li>
	<li>@wikipedia{Fairy chess pieces}: Grasshopper, Squirrel, Archbishop, Marshall, Unicorn</li>
	<li>Bonus for capture all enemy pieces on a level (rather than just running for the stairs)</li>
	<li>Win condition</li>
</ul>

One day left! I can do this.
