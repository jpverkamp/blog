title: Wombat IDE - A few minor fixes/enchancments
---
There are just a few end of the month bug fixes and enhancements this time:
<ul>
	<li>(Hopefully finally) fixed the long standing <a title="Issue 2: Automatic indentation sometimes gets out of sync" href="https://code.google.com/p/wombat-ide/issues/detail?id=2">Issue 2</a>: Automatic indentation sometimes gets out of sync</li>
	<li>Added a recent documents menu</li>
	<li>Added an option to reset custom color scheme to the default</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where the program wouldn't close if text was waiting to be displayed</li>
</ul>

<!--more-->

One bigger addition was that the bracket matcher now colors mismatched brackets as shown here (there is a closing parenthesis against an opening square bracket):
