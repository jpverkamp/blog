Just a few bug fixes this time:
<ul>
	<li>A few fixes for error message related to incorrect usage of car and cdr to better match what Chez gives</li>
	<li>Tweaks to clean up the build system</li>
	<li>Fixed the JAR signing system to automatically sign JARs only if they're out of date (prevents Webstart from re-downloading them)</li>
</ul>
