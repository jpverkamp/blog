title: Wombat IDE - Bug fixes and new image code
---
First, bug fixes:
<ul>
	<li>Fixed an issue that made the C211 libraries disappear on a reset</li>
	<li>`list` should be printed as a procedure (rather than a type)</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where reload would fail</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where the wrong procedure name would be printed in errors in make-image and image-map</li>
	<li>Added code to automatically add a git tag on deploy (based on the version number)</li>
</ul>
Also, I've rewritten the image code (especially `read-`, `write-`, and `draw-image`) to make them significantly faster. They were already faster then the pure Scheme versions, but this should add at least a bit more. It will be particularly helpful later in the semester during some of the more image heavy assignments.

Edit: The most up to date C211 image library API can be found <a title="C211 Image API" href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/cgi-pub/c211/wombat/docs/c211-image.htm">here</a>.
