title: Wombat IDE - A pile of features and bugs
---
Another one of those posts. :)

Bug fixes:
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem with the interop libraries reporting they were finished before they actually were. Now when reading a few hundred images, the call will block until they are actually read rather than just pretending to read them as it was.</li>
	<li><a title="Issue 158" href="http://code.google.com/p/wombat-ide/issues/detail?id=158">Issue 158</a>: Prevent backups of backup files (no double ~). Basically, if a person directly edits a backup file, they're on their own.</li>
	<li><a title="Issue 163" href="http://code.google.com/p/wombat-ide/issues/detail?id=163">Issue 163</a>: Better image scaling for the `draw-image` dialog.</li>
	<li>Fixed a few minor copy/paste errors in the <a title="Wombat IDE â€“ C211 Matrix Library" href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2011/12/12/wombat-ide-c211-matrix-library/">matrix library</a>.</li>
	<li>The dialog produced by `draw-tree` now has the same background color as that produced by `draw-image` or `draw-matrix`.</li>
</ul>
Enhancements:
<ul>
	<li><a title="Issue 160" href="http://code.google.com/p/wombat-ide/issues/detail?id=160">Issue 160</a>: The relative paths for `read-image` and `write-image` now respect the path set by the current-directory function rather than the relative path set by Java.</li>
	<li><a title="Issue 162" href="http://code.google.com/p/wombat-ide/issues/detail?id=162">Issue 162</a>: Added a menu option to load files directly into the REPL without opening them. This should be useful for things like large datafiles (still written in Scheme though).</li>
	<li>Added initial version of a @wikipedia{turtle graphics} library. I'll talk about this more when I finish it.</li>
</ul>
The Wombat launcher will automatically download the newest version for you. If you don't have the launcher, you can get it <a title="Wombat Launcher Download Page" href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/cgi-pub/c211/wombat/">here</a>.
