In case you missed them (and the title of this post), there's a few more buttons on the toolbar. The middle section is Cut, Copy, Past, Undo, and Redo. It's getting a little wide, but still not too bad. I could probably add a couple more buttons.

Second, there's a right margin drawn at 80 characters (based on the current font size). This is really helpful as we print out assignments when we're grading, two up to save paper. This means that any code more than 80 characters wide is automatically wrapped and gets harder to read. So this will give students a visual indication that their code is wider than it should be. Hopefully that will prevent cases that we've actually seen when lines get over 400 characters wide.
