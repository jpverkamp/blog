Threads can get all sorts of interesting sometimes. And fun to debug. Essentially, whenever the user would restart the Petite process (using the Stop button) a new output thread would be spawned. There wasn't any problem with the output being duplicated or lost--I already had locking in place to prevent that--but what would happen is that the threads would interleave the output, scrambling output nicely.

Things like this got all sorts of possible:

Expected:
<pre>~ (let loop ([i 0])
    (when (< i 10)
      (display i)
      (loop (+ i 1))))
0123456789</pre>
Actual:
<pre>~ (let loop ([i 0])
    (when (< i 10)
      (display i)
      (loop (+ i 1))))
0123<span style="color: #ff0000;">46</span>789<span style="color: #ff0000;">5</span></pre>
(And it only got worse from there.)

It took a bit longer than I would have liked to track that down, but I finally managed to fix it so that only a single thread would be started no matter how many times the user restarts Petite.
