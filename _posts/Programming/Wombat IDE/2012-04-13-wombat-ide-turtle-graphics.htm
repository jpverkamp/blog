As I mentioned in my last post, I've been adding a @wikipedia{turtle graphics} library to Wombat to use with the other C211 libraries (<a title="Wombat IDE – C211 Matrix Library" href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2011/12/12/wombat-ide-c211-matrix-library/">matrix</a>, <a title="Wombat IDE – C211 tree and image libraries" href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2011/08/27/c211-tree-and-image-libraries/">image</a>, and <a title="Wombat IDE – C211 tree and image libraries" href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2011/08/27/c211-tree-and-image-libraries/">tree</a>).

</ul>

<b>Edit</b>: This post used an old version of the turtle graphics API, specifically using the function `spawn` rather than `hatch` in the code examples. So that the code will run in the newer version of Wombat, I have updated the examples.

Essentially, to think about turtle graphics, consider as a thought experiment a turtle standing in the middle of a giant blank white sheet of paper. Tied to the turtle's tail is a marker, initially in black. From there, you can issue a series of commands to the turtle, for example, telling it to `move!` or to `turn-left!` or `turn-right!`. You can also tell the turtle to `lift-pen!` and stop drawing, `drop-pen!` and start again, or even `set-pen-color!` to change to a different marker. Finally, there are some meta commands that allow you to either `split` into more turtles that will work in parallel, to run a `block` of commands and then reset back to the original state, or even to `repeat` a series of commands. For anything else, just check out the API:
<h2>`(c211 turtle)` API</h2>
<h3>Creating turtles:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>`(hatch)` - create a new turtle</li>
	<li>`(hatch dir)` - create a new turtle with the given facing (in degrees, 0 is north, positive to the right / clockwise)</li>
	<li>`(hatch x y)` - create a turtle at the point (`x`, `y`) instead of the origin</li>
	<li>`(hatch x y dir)` - create a turtle at (`x`, `y`) with the given facing</li>
	<li>`(hatch x y dir up/down color)` - create a turtle at (`x`, `y`) with the given facing and a `color` pen that is either `up` or `down`</li>
	<li>`(split t)` - create a copy of a turtle so that the two can move in parallel (for branching structures)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Movement:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>`(move! t n)` - move the turtle `n` units in whichever direction it is facing; draw a line if the pen is `down`</li>
	<li>`(move-to! t x y)` - jump directly to the point (`x`, `y`), preserving the original facing; draw a line if the pen is `down`</li>
	<li>`(turtle-location t)` - return the turtle's current location as a list of the form `(x y)`</li>
	<li>`(turn-left! t d)` - turn left / counter-clockwise this many degrees.</li>
	<li>`(turn-right! t d)` - turn right / clockwise this many degrees</li>
	<li>`(turn-to! t d)` - turn directly to a given facing (in degrees, 0 is north, positive to the right / clockwise)</li>
	<li>`(turtle-direction t)` - return the turtle's current facing</li>
</ul>
<h3>Drawing:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>`(lift-pen! t)` - lift the turtle's pen and stop drawing</li>
	<li>`(drop-pen! t)` - drop the turtle's pen and start drawing again</li>
	<li>`(pen-up/down? t)` - return either `up` if the pen is up or `down` if it's down</li>
	<li>`(set-pen-color! t c)` - set the turtle's pen's color; colors can be accessed from `(c211 image)`</li>
	<li>`(pen-color t)` - access the turtle's pen's current color as a color from `(c211 image)`</li>
</ul>
<h3>Output:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>`(draw-turtle t)` - draw the turtle and any turtles `split` from it to the screen; if this turtle was the result of a split, its parent will not be drawn</li>
	<li>`turtle->image` - convert the turtle to an image from `(c211 image)`, `(draw-turtle t)` is equivalent to `(draw-image (turtle->image t))`</li>
</ul>
<div>
<h3>Useful macros:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>`(block t cmds ...)` - save the turtle's current state then execute a series of commands; then reset the turtle to the stored state</li>
	<li>`(repeat n cmds ...)` - repeat a series of commands n times; does not restore turtle state</li>
</ul>
</div>
To use the turtle graphics library, you will have to import it with `(import (c211 turtle))`. After that, just give the above commands a try.
<h2>Examples</h2>
Here are some interesting turtles that I've written/translated from the @wikipedia["Wikipedia page on L-Systems"]{L-system}.
<h2>Box:</h2>
To start out with, a simple box. This shows how to move, how to turn, and how to use the `repeat` macro. In this example and all of the following ones, a new turtle is hatched when calling the function and returned at the end. The functions could have been written to take a turtle as an argument, alter its state, and return nothing--that's just not how I did it.

@codeblock["scheme"]|{
(define box
  (lambda ()
    (let ([t (hatch)])
      (repeat 4
        (move! t 100)
        (turn-right! t 90))
      t)))

(draw-turtle (box))
}|

<h3>Sierpinski triangle:</h3>
Next, the traditional @wikipedia{Sierpinski triangle}. This is based on the @wikipedia["L-systems Wikipedia"]{L-system} page, using function calls for the recursive generating function. The original two inverse calls have been combined into the single loop, using the sign of the variable `d` to control which way the rotation is currently going.

@codeblock["scheme"]|{
(define sierpinski
  (lambda (n) 
    (let ([t (hatch)])
      (turn-right! t 30)
      (let loop ([i 0] [d 60])
        (if (= i n)
            (begin
              (set-pen-color! t
                (color 0 0 (mod (+ (color-ref 
                                     (pen-color t) 
                                     'blue)
                                   (random 10))
                             256)))
              (move! t 20))
            (begin
              (loop (+ i 1) (- d))
              (turn-right! t d)
              (loop (+ i 1) d)
              (turn-right! t d)
              (loop (+ i 1) (- d)))))
      t)))

(draw-turtle (sierpinski 5))
}|

<h3>Recursive tree:</h3>
A simple tree that starts with a single turtle and `split`s into two additional turtles at each iteration. Using a proper rendering (which I haven't actually written yet), you could see all of the branches expanding outwards in parallel.

@codeblock["scheme"]|{
(define tree
  (lambda (n)
    (let ([t (hatch)])
      (let loop ([i 0] [t t])
        (when (< i n)
          (set-pen-color! t (color 0 (+ 128 (random 128)) 0))
          (move! t 50)
          (let ([l (split t)]
                [r (split t)])
            (loop (+ i 1) t)
            (turn-left! l (random 45))
            (loop (+ i 1) l)
            (turn-right! r (random 45))
            (loop (+ i 1) r))))
      t)))

(draw-turtle (tree 5))
}|

<h3>Recursive star:</h3>
Rather than using `split` as the tree above does, this star uses a combination of `repeat` (to get the multiple arms) and `block` (to reset to the center for new extension).

@codeblock["scheme"]|{
(define star
  (lambda (p n)
    (let ([t (hatch)])
      (let loop ([i 0] [d 100])
        (when (< i n)
          (set-pen-color! t (color 0 (div (* 255 i) n) 0))
          (repeat p
            (turn-right! t (/ 360 p))
            (block t
              (move! t d)
              (loop (+ i 1) (/ d 2))))))
      t)))

(draw-turtle (star 5 3))
}|

<h3>Dragon fractal:</h3>
This is a pretty fractal translated almost directly from the @wikipedia{L-System} Wikipedia page. Each recursive level became a function directly this time. The coloring is randomly selected tones from yellow to red.

@codeblock["scheme"]|{
(define dragon
  (lambda (n)
  (let ([t (hatch)]
        [angle 90]
        [distance 10])
    (define (f)
      (set-pen-color! t
        (let* ([r (+ 128 (random 128))]
               [g (min r (random 255))]
               [b 0])
          (color r g b)))
      (move! t distance))
    (define (x i)
      (when (< i n)
        (x (+ i 1))
        (turn-right! t angle)
        (y (+ i 1))
        (f)))
    (define (y i)
      (when (< i n)
        (f)
        (x (+ i 1))
        (turn-left! t angle)
        (y (+ i 1))))
    (turn-left! t 90)
    (move! t distance)
    (x 0)
    t)))

(draw-turtle (dragon 12))
}|
