A few minor enhancements with the new Petite-based builds:
<ul>
	<li>Start case sensitive by default</li>
	<li>Added a library directory in preparation for the new C211 libraries</li>
	<li>Added code to prevent gensym printing (makes records more readable in general)</li>
	<li>Re-added the C211 tree library (except for draw-tree), it's pure Scheme but the API has<a title="Wombat IDE – C211 tree and image libraries" href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2011/08/27/c211-tree-and-image-libraries/"> remained the same</a></li>
</ul>
I still haven't pushed an official build for the students to actually use, but we're getting closer. I think by the time that the students get to the midterm or so, we should be ready to switch over.
