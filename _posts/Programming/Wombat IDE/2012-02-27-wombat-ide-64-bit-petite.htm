title: Wombat IDE - 64 bit Petite
---
64-bit Linux and OSX machines will now download a 64-bit version of Petite rather than the previous 32-bit versions that I was downloading for all of the systems. This should mostly help to alleviate problems that some people were having with installing the necessary 32-bit libraries on their systems. Unfortunately, this requires an update to the actual launcher, so anyone that needs the new features will need a <a title="Wombat Download Page" href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/cgi-pub/c211/wombat/">new build of the launcher</a>. After that, the automatic update should proceed as normal.

If you want to switch over to the new versions of Wombat, you can get itÂ <a title="Wombat Launcher Download" href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/cgi-pub/c211/wombat/">here</a>. You should have at least version 2.58.2.
