I've been putting off a new release for a while while I collect a number of minor bug fixes and enhancements, but I think it's about time to actually release them. <a title="Wombat Download Page" href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/cgi-pub/c211/wombat/">1.327.1</a> is the new build.

<!--more-->

A few bug fixes:
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug on some *nix machines where the launcher wouldn't find the correct directory (the directory is now derived from the running JAR's location)</li>
	<li>Fixed a type typo in `image-ref`</li>
	<li>Added a corrected error message for negative array indexes (for example, trying to make an image with a negative size)</li>
	<li>Added a bunch of mapped types to error messages (numbers, voids, strings, etc)</li>
</ul>
<div>And a few new features:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Added a link to the launcher to the index page</li>
	<li>Moved all of the IDE related files into their own directory in preparation to split development (the launcher is a second project at the moment)</li>
	<li>`#void` will print when nested in another structure `(list (void))`, but not directly</li>
	<li>Added the function `atom?`</li>
</ul>
