For those of you that may have figured out last week’s band but did not have a chance to look it up it online, the answer was Nightwish.

For this week’s band, we will go back several decades and to a different country of origin. Here are the clues:

Originally formed in 1957, this band went through a number of changes both in name and members before settling on their final name lineup in 1960. Throughout the 60s, the band recorded 12 studio albums and a number of singles, touring in the United States and their native England. After a number of disputes, the band finally dissolved in 1970. Within a few months of the breakup, all four of the individual members released solo albums.

Despite a career spanning little more than a decade, this band has set an astounding number of records around the world. With over one billion albums sold, they are the best selling musical group of all time. In addition, they hold the record for the fastest selling album of all time. In only four weeks, it sold 13 million copies. Finally, on April 4, 1964, this band became the only band in history to hold all five of the top positions on the Billboard singles chart.

In addition to their musical career, this band released two full length films, an hour-long television movie, a documentary, an animated film, and a Saturday morning cartoon series. Furthermore, on September 21, 2007, another new movie will open inspired in large part by this band's music.
