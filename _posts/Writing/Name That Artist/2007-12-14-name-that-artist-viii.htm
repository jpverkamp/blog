title: Name That Artist VIII
---
Born on January 8, 1935, this artist was on top of the world for much of the next 42 years until his death in 1977. Although he mainly performed and recorded rockability--a mix of country with rhythm and blues backed by a strong, upbeat tempo--he also branched into a number of other genres, including the blues, ballads, gospel, and pop. To date, this artist is the only artist to have been inducted into four musical halls of fame.

Including compilations and soundtracks, this artist released or was featured on 76 different albums during the course of his lifetime, spending a combined total of over 60 weeks on top of the charts. Total sales for this artist’s albums are estimated to have reached 1.8 billion sales. All together, 149 of this artist’s single reached the Top 100 in the United States and 150 of his albums and singles reached gold status. In addition to music, this artist also filmed 33 films--many of them little more than musicals.

One part of this artist’s fame began, according to legend, quite by accident. At his first live performance, this artist was so nervous that his legs were shaking. Combined with wide-legged pants that emphasized his movements, this motion supposedly drove the women in the audience crazy. Realizing the benefits of this effect, this artist purposely incorporated the movements into future shows.
