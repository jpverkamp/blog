title: Name That Artist VII
---
This week’s artist has been recording and performing almost twice as long as most students here at Rose have been alive, first recording with a high school friend for Duel Records in 1960.

From the 1960s through most of the 1980s this artist continued to be one of the most popular pop music artists of the time with 37 top 40 singles. Of those, 12 reached the top 10 and 3 were number one hits. With all of these hit singles comes a great number of albums, including 28 studio albums, seven live albums, and 22 compilations some released as recently as last year.

In 1984, this artist was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Although eligible for the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame since 1989, he has thus far been passed over. In addition, this artist is somewhat unique in the fact that he is the copyright owner, unlike the norm where the recording company or another party holds the copyrights to an artist or groups songs.

Married twice, in 1963 and 1969, this artist has four children. When divorcing his second wife in 1995, the settlement was the fourth largest at the time, totaling over 0 million. When asked for comment, this artist responded with, 'she has earned every penny.'

For anyone that can remember that far back, last time’s group was composed of musician/actor duo Kyle Gass and Jack Black, better known as Tenacious D. For this week’s answer, go to http://www.rose-hulman.edu/thorn.
