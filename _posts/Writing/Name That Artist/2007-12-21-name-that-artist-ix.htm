Combining a number of sub genres of rock, including hard rock, blues-rock, acid rock, and psychedelic rock, this artist strove to create a fusion of what he referred to as 'earth' and 'space,' a rhythmic background driven by blues or funk with overtones of high-pitched guitar sounds created by a feedback loop on an overdriven amplifier.

Despite living only 27 years, between 1942 and 1970, this artist still is responsible for eight studio albums, 19 live albums, 29 compilation albums, 3 soundtracks. Of his first five albums, four reached the top five in both the United States and the UK.

In addition to his prolific volume of work, this artist has been recognized a number of times, with his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, induction into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1994.

For those of you who did not recognize him, last weekâ€™s artist was the King of Rock and Roll: Elvis Presley.
