Born in 1940, this English rock musician was one of the founding members of a previous Name That Artist band. After the band dissolved in 1970, this artist continued to record and perform independently until his untimely death in 1980.

Independently, this artist released eight studio albums and 14 compilations, including three number one hits in the United States and the United Kingdom. Beyond those, he released three experimental avant-garde albums consisting of tape loops and experimentation with instruments and effects. The first of the three was controversial in many markets due to its cover. The front cover featured the artist and his future second wife completely nude--the back showed the same image from another prospective.

In addition to his musical talent, this artist was well known as a political activist including performing at a number of concerts including one that aimed to free John Sinclair--an antiwar activist who was serving ten years for selling marijuana to an undercover cop. Three days after the concert, John Sinclair was released from prison.

Unfortunately, this artist was shot in front of his home in New York City, dying the next day. A lasting memorial has been set up at the Strawberry Fields memorial garden in Central Park across the street from the scene of the shooting. Many fans of this artist’s work gather there throughout the year, especially on his birthday and the anniversary of his death.

Last week’s artist was Bob Marley, for this week’s answer go to the website or wait until next week.
