Hailing from the land down under, this week’s artist’s first claim to fame came in the form of an Ednaswap cover. This song eventually went on to become one of the biggest hits of the 90s, holding the number one position on the Billboard Airplay chart for 14 weeks. Also, in October 1997, it broke the record in the United Kingdom for being most played for six consecutive weeks (with over 2000 plays in that time). In addition, in 2004, this artist was ranked the 6th most naturally beautiful of all time.

Since the release of her first single, this artist has released three studio albums and a single compilation. Her debut album peaked at number two in the UK and number 14 in the United States and has since reached status as a double platinum album. Her work has also appeared in the soundtracks for Stigmata and Go and as the theme song for the Italian film Winx Club.

In addition to her musical career, this artist also had a support role in the 2003 British comedy Johnny English and has the lead role in the upcoming Australian independent file Elise. In addition, she played a role in the Australian soap Neighbors, and appeared in the second season of Celebrity Deathmatch, alongside Mel Gibson and Paul Hogan. Beginning in 2002 this artist also acted as a worldwide spokesperson for L’Oreal, although the contract expired in July 2007 and has not been renewed.
