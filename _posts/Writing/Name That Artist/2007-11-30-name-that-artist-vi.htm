This week's group is best known for music that combines rock music with comedy in a style best known as mock rock. The duo met in Edinburgh, Scotland back when both were traveling with a theatrical group based in Los Angeles.

As do many other bands, this band's name comes from a relatively unique origin. At their first live performance in 1994, they put their band's name to a vote, ousting other potential names such as 'Pets or Meat' and 'Balboa's Biblical Theatre' before finally settling on their final name.

Three years later, in 1997, this group went on to produce and star in their own, self-titled TV show. Although six episodes were produced, each 10-12 minutes in length, only two were aired in 1997. The other four were held until later airing in 2000.

One year later, in 2001, this band released their first album which managed to reach number 33 on the Billboard charts. Despite the fact that the band usually appears as a duo, their album included a full band backup. As the younger of the two members said at the time, "no one's ever heard us with a band." Following the release of the album, the band released a further pair of follow up singles.

Finally, in 2004, the band began work on a film that would portray a fictional account of the history of the band and their rise to super-stardom. The film was released earlier this year and brought in a total of 13 million dollars worldwide.

Last week's artist was composer Yoko Kanno.
