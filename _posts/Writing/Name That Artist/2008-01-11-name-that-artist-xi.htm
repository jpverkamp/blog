Born on the island of Jamaica in 1945, this week’s artist is most likely the best known reggae artist ever. One of his posthumous albums has sold 12 million copies worldwide since its release, earning the title of best selling reggae album. During his relatively short lifetime, this artist released 16 studio albums (one posthumously), four live albums, and ten compilations (only 1 released before his death).

Throughout the years, this artist has collected a number of awards and other forms of recognition from around the world. In 1976, Rolling Stone magazine named his band the Band of the Year and in 2004 he placed #11 in the magazines 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 1978, he received the Peace Medal of the Third World from the United Nations and in 1981 he was recognized with Jamaica’s third highest honor, the Jamaican Order of Merit. Finally, in 1994, this artist was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and in 2001, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

In addition to being a musician, this artist was also well known as a proponent and prophet of the Rastafarian movement, bringing their music out of areas of Jamaica prone to social deprivation into the world scene. This artist is also well known for his adoption of the Rastafarian-style dreadlocks and use of cannabis as a sacred sacrament.

In 1977, this artist was diagnosed with cancer in his toe (due in large part to a soccer injury); however, due to the Rastafarian belief that the body must remain whole, he declined amputation. He continued performing and recording until his death in 1981 at the age of 36.
