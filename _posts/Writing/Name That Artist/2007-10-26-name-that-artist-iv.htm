	<li>Beyond being a singer, songwriter, composer, producer and actor, this artist has been nominated for numerous awards, including two Golden Globes, an Academy Award and 12 Grammys. This artist was also ranked as number eight on MTV?s '22 Greatest Voices in Music.'</li>
	<li>Active since 1977, this artist has had quite a career featuring a variety of genres including, but definitely not limited to, alternative rock, electronic, trip-hop, jazz and pop. All together, this artist has released 11 solo albums, four box-sets, 26 singles and 32 music videos.</li>
	<li>This artist's fame did not come without its price as an incident from 1996 shows. After filming a 22 hour long video detailing his obsession with this artist, Ricardo Lopez mailed the artist an acid bomb and killed himself. Fortunately, the London police intercepted the package before it arrived.</li>
	<li>Finally, this artist tends towards a more eccentric approach in his or her music videos. This is mirrored in his or her real life with an Icelandic magic sign tattoo on his or her left arm, representing a compass.</li>
