title: NaNoWriMo 2012
---
It's November and you know what that means... <a title="nanowrimo" href="http://nanowrimo.org">National Novel Writing Month</a>! Okay, so maybe you didn't know that, but now you do. :smile:

<!--more-->

In any case, I'll be participating again this year for my second NaNoWriMo. I "won" last year by completing <a title="My NaNoWriMo 2011" href="http://nanowrimo.org/en/participants/jpverkamp/novels/nanowrimo-167134">my 50,000 words</a> within the month of November (50,147 to be exact). Last year, I wrote about a darker steampunk setting which I hope to eventually rework into a full novel. We'll see how that goes. For this year, I've been having a bit of writer's block so far as fiction is concerned the past month or so, but hopefully this will be a push to getting back into the swing of things.

What does that mean for my blog? Well, essentially my goal will be to post twice a day. I'll continue my regularly scheduled posts at 9am each morning, either on programming topics or <a title="A Sea of Stars" href="blog.jverkamp.com/category/writing/novels/a-sea-of-stars/">A Sea of Stars</a> each Tuesday and Friday. The programming posts will likely start with the <a title="Project Euler" href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> posts I've been meaning to post which will help time-wise as most of the code for at least a month or two has already been written.

Then whenever I finish my NaNoWriMo progress for the day, I'll post that as well (<a title="nanowrimo 2012" href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/category/writing/novels/nanowrimo-2012/">web page</a>, <a title="nanowrimo-2012 feed" href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/category/writing/novels/nanowrimo-2012/feed/">rss</a>). I tend to write in the evenings, so most likely that's when I'll post. For what it's worth, the NaNoWriMo content will likely be only minimally edited as the goal is for quantity rather than necessarily quality. I'm still not sure what I'll be writing, but I guess we'll all see shortly.

If you have any questions/comments/suggestions, I'd of course love feedback, either here in the comments, on <a title="Twitter: jpverkamp" href="http://twitter.com/@"@"jpverkamp">Twitter</a>, or on <a title="Facebook: jpverkamp" href="https://www.facebook.com/jpverkamp">Facebook</a>. Just let me know.

It should be an interesting ride. :smile:

<strong>Edit:</strong> I was on a roll and already wrote the first section. 1700 and change words, so I'm at least ahead of the required 1,667 words / day to finish on time. We'll see how long I can keep that up. You can read it here: @crosslink{Confession - Day 1}

<strong>Edit 2:</strong> Here's a list that should stay up to date as I post more chapters:
