Yup. Even with a new baby around, I'm mad enough to do it.

So far I've been keeping up 2000 words per day, but I'm already starting to feel a drag. It just feels like the same sort of story I've written before... We'll see in the next day or two if I try to reboot or just go with it.

I haven't yet decided if I'm going to publish them online this year. It's good motivation and I know at least a few of you out there read it. We'll see. If I do, it won't be daily, but rather after finishing each chapter. So every 2-4 days? 

Wish me luck!
