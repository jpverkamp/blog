title: NaNoWriMo 2013 - Computational Demonology
---
Yup, I'm doing it again. And this time, I'm doing it while finishing my PhD, working a full time job, and adapting to life two thousand miles away from where I was born. Should be interesting. :smile:

I'll admit, November sort of snuck up on me. I went into the month with basically no idea where I was going beyond a title and a first line. It's not even that good of a first line. On the flip side though, that's how I love to write (and that's what the editing process is for). We'll see how it goes.

Like last year, I'm planning on posting the story here on my blog as I write it. Unlike last year, I'm hoping to have a bit longer of chapters, so I'll try to post a new chapter twice a week. This way I can also have a bit of a buffer. So far I've kept up with 2,000 words per day which puts an average 5,000 word chapter (roughly the same as <a title="A Sea of Stars" href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/category/writing/novels/a-sea-of-stars/">Sea of Stars</a>) every two and a half days. We'll see if I can keep that up as the month progresses.

Here's a nice widget that NaNoWriMo provides. Theoretically it will keep up to date with my progress. Green days are at least 1,667 words per day (the average needed to hit 50k in November). Red are days I haven't reported yet. Since I'm on Pacific time now and NaNoWriMo appears to be on Eastern, there will be some evenings where I haven't quite made it it.

Well, that's all I have to say for now. Look for the first chapter up tomorrow morning. As always, remember this is a rough first draft. Things may change with little or no warning as the plot shifts. If/when I ever decide to try to publish this, it may look rather different than it does right now.

Wish me luck!
