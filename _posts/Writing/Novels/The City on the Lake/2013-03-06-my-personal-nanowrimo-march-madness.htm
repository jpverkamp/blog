title: My personal (NaNoWriMo) March Madness
---
Back when I @crosslink["all-good-things"]{finished my last NaNoWriMo}, I said that I'd be starting a new writing project within a couple of weeks. Well, here we are. It's more than a couple of weeks later--a bit short of two months actually. Unfortunately, I haven't really written much. There was @crosslink["observers-on-cydonia"]{a short story} and a few other blog posts and that's about it. But that's not what I want to do. I want to write. <!--more-->

So starting at the beginning of March (has it really been five days already?) I started another NaNoWriMo, just for me. There's no tracker on the NaNoWriMo website, but I really didn't use that much anyways. The goal is the same: 50,000 words in 31 days. 1,667 words per day. The only catch this time around? I'm going to try to write the entire thing the old fashioned way--by hand. ((In case you were wondering, I'm not actually going to count out the full word count by hand. That would be crazy. :) Instead, I counted up the first few pages and averaged them to get an estimate. Each page is roughly 250 words, so if I write 6-7 pages per day, I should be good.))

Yeah. I'm probably crazy. But people did it for centuries before the invention of typewriters. How hard can it be? :)

Not too bad actually. Luckily, when we learned cursive back in grade school, it actually took. I've been told that actually have pretty good handwriting (for a guy), although the above is definitely not the best example. The faster I write, the harder it is to read and the more interested I am in a topic, the faster I write. If you can actually follow the story above, color me impressed. I can make everything out, but that's mostly because I have years of experience (and I still remember more or less what I wrote in the first place).

So where does that leave posting it online? Well, I have a few options:
<ul>
	<li>I could upload the raw images. I doubt anyone would be able to read them in their entirety, although it would be interesting to see people try.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>I could transcribe each chapter to the computer. Eventually I'm going to want to do this anyways, but it takes a fair bit of time ((And I'm not particularly rich in that regard at the moment...)). I could probably do biweekly updates like I did with <a title="A Sea of Stars" href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/category/writing/novels/a-sea-of-stars/">A Sea of Stars</a>, keeping within a few days of my actual progress.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>I could just post the whole thing when I'm done with it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>I could not post it. I still haven't posted my 2011 NaNoWriMo ((Mostly because it's not actually finished)) nor have I posted the other completed first draft ((I'm planning an eventual second major rewrite on that one)). But I do like posting things; I like the feedback.</li>
</ul>
Honestly, I'm not sure which option I should go with. If anyone has a particular preference, feel free to let me know either in the comments below or <a title="contact me" href="mailto:me@"@"jverkamp.com">by email</a>.

On a related note, even if I decide not to post it here until I'm done, I've come across an idea on one of the <a title="Writing Excuses" href="http://www.writingexcuses.com/">writing podcasts</a> I listen to: beta readers. Basically, a private group of people that read what I'm writing more or less as I write it and give me some feedback on how the story is progressing. It's a bit more controlled than just posting things on my blog, but that also helps if I ever try to get published. I'm not sure if I really want to go this way, but I'm considering it. If you'd like to be a beta reader (all I'll ask of you is feedback), <a title="contact me" href="mailto:me@"@"jverkamp.com">let me know</a>!
