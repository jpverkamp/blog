title: "Spring NaNoWriMo \u2013 So close..."
---
During the month of March, I wrote 46,625 towards my newest novel. As I've mentioned before, I'm writing this one by hand, so it's a bit slower going than typing, albeit with less distractions. So falling less than 10% shy of the (admittedly pretty arbitrary) NaNoWriMo target isn't too bad. And I did hit my own goal of six hand written pages per day (I got 6.01). So none too shabby.

Where do we go from here?<!--more-->

Well, I just hit the first major climax of the story. Things have gotten far more interesting for the main characters as they find themselves in a bit of an ethical conundrum between the status quo and the life of a young boy. The main character is coming to terms with her mysterious powers and they've finally managed to get a few answers out of the strange, young Runebound nobleman.

If any of that sounds interesting, drop me a line. I'd love to have more beta readers. As of yet, I haven't caught up transcribing my notebook, but I'm going to have to do it eventually. :)

Speaking of notebooks, I need a new one. When I decided to write by hand this month, I didn't actually have a notebook. Cue a quick midnight trip to the store, and I'm off. It's <em>only</em> 108 pages (front and back; it's really cool to flip through now that it's almost full), so now I'm down to 4 days worth of pages. At the moment, I'm torn between getting another identical notebook and using one of the dozens I already have. I may have to make a decision by default though--I looked today and neither Amazon nor any local store seems to carry an exact match. So it goes.

Onward and upward to another month!

I've registered on <a title="Camp NaNoWriMo" href="http://campnanowrimo.org/">Camp NaNoWriMo</a> if you'd like to follow my progress: <a title="The City on Camp NaNoWriMo" href="http://campnanowrimo.org/campers/jpverkamp/novels/the-city-working-title">The City (working title)</a>

Theoretically, I'll update that every day or two. I'm going to stick with 6 pages / 1,500 words per day, although the page count may change if I switch to another notebook.
