Over a year ago now, I decided that I want to write. Not the little things that I've been publishing here, but full novels. Twelve months and more than a million words later, I think that it's about time to start posting them here. First up, I have <a title="Novel - A Sea of Stars" href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/category/writing/novel/a-sea-of-stars/">A Sea of Stars</a>, my try at science fiction. I've edited it somewhat, but it'll probably still be rough at times. Feel free to leave comments about either content or grammar.

The goal is to post one chapter each morning on Tuesdays and Fridays. The entire thing should be available by the end of October.

Each post will be available here on this blog under <a title="Writing" href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/category/writing/">Writing</a> > <a title="Writing > Novels" href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/category/writing/novels/">Novels</a> > <a title="Writing > Novels > A Sea of Stars" href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/category/writing/novels/a-sea-of-stars/">A Sea of Stars</a>. You can get an RSS feed for just A Sea of Stars <a title="RSS Feed: Writing > Novels > A Sea of Stars" href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/category/writing/novels/a-sea-of-stars/feed/">here</a> or including any future novels <a title="RSS Feed: Writing > Novels" href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/category/writing/novels/feed/">here</a>. Alternatively, I'll do my best to keep up an index <a title="Novels" href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/novels/">here</a>.

It should be an interesting time. :)
