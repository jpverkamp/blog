title: And so it ends
---
And just like that, it was done. That's the last chapter of <a title="A Sea of Stars" href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/category/writing/novels/a-sea-of-stars/">A Sea of Stars</a>. I'm not perfectly happy with it--I know that I'm not so great at endings. But I think it works out well enough. And looking back on A Sea of Stars, I can see how much more solid my writing has gotten in the months since I finished it. If I were to go back to it now, it might be an entirely different story. We'll see how much of that comes through when I edit it.

When I @crosslink["so-ive-been-writing"]{first started posting} these back in August, I didn't know how it was going to go. I didn't know if people would actually like what I was doing or if I would basically be shouting at the wind. There's been a bit of both, but for the most part, I think it was pretty successful.

If anyone has been reading along the whole time and would like to leave a comment, I'd love to hear it, even if if's just a 'hey I read this' sort of thing. I can tell how many people are visiting my webpage, but I have a feeling at least a few people are reading solely via <a title="RSS Feeds" href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/rss-feeds/">RSS feeds</a> and I can't as easily count those. You can either leave a comment on any of the posts or just drop me an email: <a href="mailto:me@"@"jverkamp.com">me@"@"jverkamp.com</a>

Constructive criticism would be great as well. I hope to put this (and other works) up on Amazon in the upcoming weeks/months so I'll be doing another editing pass before that. I'll post here when I do.

I'm also hoping to start posting another novel shortly, although I'll probably wait until December to start as <a title="My NaNoWriMo" href="http://nanowrimo.org/en/participants/jpverkamp">NaNoWriMo</a> is still in full swing. I have two in the works that I could publish:
<ul>
	<li>The Gates of Heaven (urban fantasy, will probably get a new title)</li>
	<li>Shadows and Steam (dark steampunk, <a title="NaNoWriMo 2011: Shadows and Steam" href="http://nanowrimo.org/en/participants/jpverkamp/novels/shadows-and-steam">NaNoWriMo 2011</a>, currently unfinished)</li>
</ul>
If you have a preference for which you'd rather see, just let me know. At the moment, I could go either way.

Well, that's that. It's been a long, strange journey. Thank you for sharing it with me.

<em>PS: Out of curiosity, has anyone read @wikipedia["Allen Steele's"]{Allen Steele} Coyote books? If you have, just let it be known that I actually wrote A Sea of Stars before I read those, believe it or not. :smile:</em>
