@embed{Winner.jpg}50,000 words in 30 days. Sounds crazy (and it totally is), but I did it! Whee!<!--more-->

Technically, I finished already on Wednesday with a crazy 5,000 words day, although I posted half of that yesterday. Today's work is just icing on top of the cake.Â I started writing about 8pm and didn't finish until something like 1 in the morning (which works about to about 1,000 words / hour). I've only done that two or three times since I started writing. A good finish though. Unlike last year, I don't have to rush at the last minute to 'validate' it over at the <a title="NaNoWriMo: jpverkamp" href="http://nanowrimo.org/en/participants/jpverkamp">NaNoWriMo</a> site.

Of course I'm by no means finished. When I started the story, the first thing that I did was introduce Father Thomas' three mortal sins and so far none of them has been formally introduced. So there's still a way to go. Things are coming together though.

My goal is to hit about 100,000 words. That's generally considered a good length for a novel and that's roughly how long <a title="A Sea of Stars" href="blog.jverkamp.com/category/writing/novels/a-sea-of-stars/">A Sea of Stars</a> ended up being. That way there's plenty of room to cut without running down into novella territory. So I'm most likely going to keep posting through the month of December as well until all is said and done.

I hope people are enjoying reading these as much as I'm enjoying publishing them. It's definitely been an interesting ride.
