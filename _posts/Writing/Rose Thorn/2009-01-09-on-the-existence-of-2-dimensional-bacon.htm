title: On the existence of 2-dimensional bacon
---
Only at Rose might one wander, unsuspecting, into a computer lab and stumble blindingly into a discussion on the finer merits and potential pitfalls of 2-dimensional bacon. And only at Rose might such a conversation take place with naught but the faintest hint of absurdity. Yet here we are, at Rose, where such discussions might well take place.

First, one must consider the base case: typical 3-dimensional (4 if you must count time, more for some of the physics majors) bacon delicious and nutritious--or delicious at the very least--bacon should, in and of itself, inspire awe.

Now, consider the lesser case, so far as the number of dimensions are concerned: 2-dimensional bacon. Perfectly flat, so far as to have no thickness whatsoever, such bacon may just be the ultimate food. Because it has no thickness, you may stack as much bacon as you like onto a single plate and still not feel overburdened. In addition, for the average time-constrained Rose student, you can consume an entire stack of bacon in one fell swoop; merely fold it into a stack, still without thickness.

Nothing in life is free; however, and such amazement is not without cost. First, consider how one might go about actually producing such bacon. One might approximate 2-dimensional bacon by using tiny machines to organically manufacture a single layer of bacon molecules (biology majors, are you listening?); however, with thickness, slight as it may be, this does not yet satisfy our hunger.

Second, one must consider, given the existence of such bacon, the drawbacks in consuming it. First and foremost, how might one be able to actually lift said bacon from its platter? Or even see it for that matter? If one were so unlucky as to accidentally turn their bacon on its side, it might very well disappear forever. Additionally, if one is able to lift the bacon from its plate, might it not sever his or her head upon attempting to eat it? After all, the edge of such bacon is extraordinarily thin. Finally, would a consumer of such bacon even be able to enjoy his or her prize? After all, a 2-dimensional slice of bacon has no thickness; how might it then interact with 3-dimensional taste buds and 3-dimensional olfactory glands?

Overall, it appears that we must do without such a treat, at least for the time being. But I, for one, am looking forward to the day when we might overcome these obstacles and enjoy the joys of 2-dimensional bacon.
