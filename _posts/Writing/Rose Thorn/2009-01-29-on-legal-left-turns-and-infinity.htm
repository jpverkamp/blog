Only at Rose might one ponder the existance of stoplights on one-way roads to the level of considering the potential of infinite loops at such points.

First, consider that, so far as I can tell from Google Maps, there are 6 one-way streets in Terre Haute.  Four of them run north/south: 4th, 5th, 8th, and 9th Streets.  Two run east/west: Ohio and Walnut.  Therefore, it is not only possible but indeed expected that, of the eight possible crossings, at least half allow for a legal left turn on a red light.  While being able to turn right on a red light is a common ability in most states (except when there are signs posted telling you otherwise), such opportunities to turn left on red are somewhat more rare.

The only (legal) way to turn left on a red light--that I know of--is when you are currently driving on a one-way street and attempting to turn left onto another one-way street.  Of course, if either street is not going in the correct direction, this may not be advisable.  It turns out that turning left into another car--especially when said other car has the right of way--is generally frowned upon in most societies.

Of the eight one-way street intersections, Terre Haute has four possibilities for legally turning left on a red light--enough to form a rough rectangle.  Might it then be possible to continue driving left forever?   Unfortunately, this is not the case due a suspicious bit of layout concerning Walnut and Ohio.  If only they were to somehow switch place, one might be able to continue turning left to his or her heart's content.

But what if we were to live in a world where the streets were designed perfectly to allow for continual left turning?  Consider then the situation that might arise if the traffic lights were to malfunction and become stuck on red.  Not able to turn right (onto a one-way road) or go straight (it's a red light), we would instead be forced to continue turning left... forever!  An infinite loop, as it were...
