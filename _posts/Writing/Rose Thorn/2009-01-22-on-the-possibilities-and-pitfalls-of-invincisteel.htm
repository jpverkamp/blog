title: On the possibilities and pitfalls of InvinciSteel
---
Only at Rose might a serious discussion regarding the potential possibilities and problematic pitfalls of video game worlds take place. And only at Rose might such a discussion develop to the extent of naming that material that most likely makes up a majority of said environments: InvinciSteel. With the exception of a few rare gems, the environment in a solid majority of video games is virtually indestructible, invincible even. Since its creation at the dawn of time (or at least the dawn of video games), InvinciSteel has ruined the lives of many a gamer. Who has not been forced to take a circuitous route through implacable foes because of InvinciSteel? And furthermore, what effect does such a material have on the in-game world?

Despite possessing a rocket launcher, chainsaw bayonet, or other implement of hand-held destruction capable of tearing enemies apart with savage glee, the simplest (apparently) wooden door becomes an insurmountable obstacle worthy of minutes if not hours of sewer bound detours when made of InvinciSteel. In addition, despite driving in a gargantuan treaded behemoth of a tank, something as minor as a simple chain fence can stand in your way when reinforced with InvinciSteel links.

And yet, despite the prevalence of InvinciSteel throughout many virtual worlds, the player in such games is seemingly unable to procure any of this miraculous substance for himself. What might you do in a fighting style game with weapons (Soul Caliber or the like) if your armor was made of InvinciSteel? You’d be nearly invincible! Only attacks to exposed areas would be able to get through (I feel sorry for many of the female characters in those styles of games).

Furthermore, direct gameplay effects aside, what might the effect of such a large world made primarily out of InvinciSteel on said world’s environment be? After all, in our world, a far less indestructible material (plastic) is regularly able to wreck havoc with the environment, what effect might a far more durable substance have? And what happens when a particular piece of InvinciSteel is upgraded? You can’t very well destroy such an antequated object and melting it down for recycling purposes seems unlikely (have you ever sat down with a flame thrower in game, trying to melt a hole in a wall?). Someday, it seems likely that the waste will make up a mass greater than any other in the game environment!

Finally, consider the present day situation. Every day it seems, newer and more powerful games are being created and with that comes newer and more powerful physics engines. And with that come some of the earliest highly realistic destructible environments. It’s only a matter of time until more and more games are ridding themselves of InvinciSteel in the sake of realism. And yet, we must consider what effect this will have on the internal technology levels of said games. As our technology improves, the required advancements to create such a miraculous substance as InvinciSteel begin to fade!

Overall, InvinciSteel is an odd creation, one both highly useful (as a shortcut in creating and displaying gameworlds) and often annoying (as a roadblock used to send the players merrily to their deaths).
