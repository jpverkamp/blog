Only at Rose might such a topic such as the stackability of stacks be breached and only at Rose might one take such a topic seriously.  But, one may ask, what does that even mean? What form of stacks are being discussed? Might we be discussing stacks in the physical sense, such as a stack of blocks (or a stack of 2-dimensional bacon perchance)? Or perhaps stacks as data structures in the computer science sense? Or even the stacks present in newer versions of OS X? Or even, pray tell, the team of professional rare coin collectors (there is such a thing) at stacks.com?

But seriously, or at least as serious as one can be when discussing the finer merits of stackability, what exactly makes a stack stacky? In the first sense, of stacking physical objects, perhaps the answer is obvious. We merely wish to determine how many objects may be stacked without displacing said objects or said stack. But no, what if instead we wish to determine how compactly we might stack the objects, per the Knapsack Problem (if you can show that problem is deterministically solvable in polynomial time, I’ll buy you dinner)? So perhaps, this is not as easy a question as first proposed…

Now consider the case of the data structure stack. No matter how much you push and pop, can you ever get to a single number to determine just how stacky a stack is? Once again, one might leap directly to the assumption that size is the key issue. But then the question arises: Is it the size of the stack, or how you use it? Maybe then, the key issue to measure is just how versatile the stack in question is? After all, a stack that’s only useful for one thing is not much of a stack at all!

But then, perhaps we have not understood the original question at all! What if, instead of procuring a number to measure just how stacky a stack might be, what if we instead were tasked with finding how many stacks might be stacked, one upon the other? First, one might jump directly to the question, ‘but isn’t that the same thing as stacking objects?’ Well, is it? Are stacks just simple physical objects or is there more to stacks than meets the eye? After all, in a traditional computer science stack, one might only peek at the top, who knows what secrets lie beneath?

Overall, we may appear to be no closer to an answer than when we first started; however, let us not despair. For we are no nearer to a question either, thus rendering the answer apparently irrelevant!
