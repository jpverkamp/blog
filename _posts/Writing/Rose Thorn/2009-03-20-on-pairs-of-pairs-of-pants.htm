Only at Rose might a simple conversation pertaining to the grammatical usage of the word 'pairs' deteriorate into determination of just what constitutes a pair of pants.

At first glance, a pair of pants is singular. Each pair of pants refers to a single object of clothing, a singular entity as it were. However, the question then becomes what exactly do we have a pair of? Following traditional structural rules, you would have two pants. Considering the singular, each individual is a pant. But then what is a pant? A single leg? Just picture a collection of grammatical purists going about with a single pant (and then promptly getting arrested for public indecency).

On the other hand (or leg), considering two pairs of pants becomes much more interesting, as you now have a pair of pairs of pants. So then, just how many pants do you have? Do you have the expected two pairs of pants, or do you have four pants? Overall, running off to join a nudist colony is becoming a more viable option all the time, if only to escape the grammar.

Thus, I hereby propose that all pants shall now be treated as single legs. Therefore, a pair of pants will literally refer to two individual objects. Perhaps this can be implemented by having pants with a full zipper so that individual legs can be pulled apart and mixed and matched. Just imagine the benefits!</div>
