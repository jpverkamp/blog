For rather too long I've been sitting on several years of old pictures I took, back before I first got my DSLR. Well, there's no time like the present!

Here is the first set, from <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2004/">2004</a>.

One of the oldest sets I have--Hannah and I visited the fire tower at the Hoosier National Forest.

@crosslink{A Random Field}

Just behind home... So perhaps not so random after all?

@crosslink{Beta Convention}

This year's National Beta Convention. IU really is a beautiful campus. I'm sure my parents would be thrilled if I ended up there in a few years.

(It's interesting how things turn out.)

@crosslink{Riding at Hannah's}

Hannah and I went riding across the highway from her house. It's interesting--such a feeling of freedom.
