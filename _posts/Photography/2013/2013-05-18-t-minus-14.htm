14 days left. It's hard to really believe it.

There are also two photosynths in this set. They're still a lot of fun to take, although I haven't often (ever) included them in the same post before!

Here we are at the city center, just down from the hotel. It's starting to get on in the day, sot he lights are on around the monument.

It's a bit old timey and definitely a bit funny on the colors, but it's mostly awesome from a photosynthy point of view.
