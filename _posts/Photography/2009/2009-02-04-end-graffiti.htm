title: End - Graffiti
---
I submitted "Graffiti" for the <a href="http://www.dpchallenge.com/image.php?IMAGE_ID=762635">End</a> challenge at DPChallenge.  I cam in 94 out of 145 with a score of 4.74 / 10.  I think I may have over done the contrast on the shot, but it still turned out to be pretty interesting.
