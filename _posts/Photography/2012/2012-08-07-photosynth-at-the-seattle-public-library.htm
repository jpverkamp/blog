title: Photosynth at the Seattle Public Library
---
Here are a few more Photosynths from Seattle, this time from the Seattle Public Library. I'll admit to being more than a little impressed with the place. Why don't we have something like this in Indiana?

First, we have the Seattle Public Library from the atrium overlook (there's a little platform you can sort of see if you turn to the right which I'm guessing is designed for exactly this sort of thing):

Then, down on the 5th floor, looking back upwards:

Finally, from the outside:
