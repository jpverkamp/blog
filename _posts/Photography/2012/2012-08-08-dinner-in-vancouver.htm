title: Dinner in Vancouver
---
Yes, I flew into Seattle for the @crosslink["usenixfoci-inferring-mechanics-of-web-censorship-around-the-world"]{Usenix Security Symposium}. Yes, my parents flew into Portland for a wedding. Yes, we want to go to Vancouver for dinner, despite that fact that it's a two and a half hour drive away from Seattle. What's so hard about that Mr. Border Crossing guy?

Yeah... that was an interesting trip across the border. But they did let us across eventually! And then we were in Canada. And it turns out that our phones don't work so well in Canada, at least not without a $15/MB dataplan. So we're north of the border without maps and without a clear idea where we're going to eat, but all is good. We'll just find something when we get there...

So we ended up in West Vancouver. At some random fold festival. With some guy talking and then singing about about an anatomically correct statue in Paris. You really can't make this sort of story up.

Here's a photosynth of the beach and the guy on stage (the pink bit to the left):

We finally ended up getting food at the <a title="Savary Island Pie Company" href="http://savaryislandpiecompany.com/">Savary Island Pie Company</a>. Which was in fact savory and had pie, although I'm not sure about the island bit nor the spelling difference. In any case, it was a neat little place about a block from the shore and open late because of the festival. If you want a virtual tour, look no further!

I have to say, well worth it.
