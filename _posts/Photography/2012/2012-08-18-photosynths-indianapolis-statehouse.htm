title: Photosynths - Indianapolis Statehouse
---
We had the opportunity to go to the Indianapolis Statehouse today and I took a fair few photosynths. Just because @crosslink["usenixfoci-inferring-mechanics-of-web-censorship-around-the-world"]{Usenix} is over doesn't mean I'm quite done with the <a title="iTunes: Photosynth" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photosynth/id430065256?mt=8">photosynth app</a>. :smile:

First, the rotunda, from the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th floors:

Then, we have one from the South Atrium and another random one from the 4th floor:

Next, one from the Senate Chambers (we tried to get the House, but it was too dark to take pictures):

Finally, just for fun I took one out by the parking lot:
