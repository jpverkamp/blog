title: Conference center and Seattle Walking

First, a few photosynths from the hotel where the @crosslink["usenixfoci-inferring-mechanics-of-web-censorship-around-the-world"]{conference} was:

Since the conference was in Bellevue and I was staying in Kirkland, I was mostly taking the bus. But this one time, I decided to walk back. It was only about a five mile walk, nothing too bad. Plus, I got several more interesting Photosynths out of it. (Yes. I am addicted to this app. It's amazing.)

First, a pair walking along Bellevue Way to the north:

Then I stopped at the Houghton Beach Park for a while. I walked out onto the pier and read for a while. There was a girl sitting next to me on the pier just sitting, listening to music, so it wasn't *that* crazy...

I'll admit, the area is really growing on me. I even took a few of the flyers that they had for condos on the waterfront. Of course the one of them was about $900k to buy with a "home owner's fee" that's more than my monthly rent back home. Still, something to dream about for the future!
