Since we were in Seattle and since my father is a huge Jimi Hendrix buff, we had to go to the <a title="EMP Museum" href="http://www.empmuseum.org/">EMP Museum</a> (formerly known as both the Experience Music Project and Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame or EMP|SFM). Basically, it has exhibits all about <a title="The Official Jimi Hendrix Site" href="http://www.jimihendrix.com/us/home">Jimi Hendrix</a>, <a title="Nirvana Site" href="http://www.nirvana.com/">Nirvana</a>, <a title="AC/DC Home" href="http://www.acdc.com/us/home">AC/DC</a> and probably a number of others, along with a room full of science fiction memorabilia and another dedicated to <a title="Avatar (2009) on IMDb" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499549/">James Cameron's Avatar</a>. I highly recommend checking it out if you're in the Seattle area and into either music or science fiction (particularly if you're do both).

I only got one Photosynth from the event, but I think that it's a pretty amazing one. It's from the "Sky Church" a 40 foot high, 70 foot wide screen showing all sorts of videos. By now astute observers may be able to figure out the people in the Photosynths that are related to me by the sheer fact that they keep appearing in each of them.

If you turn around (in the Photosynth), you should be able to see a giant sculpture made of guitars in the main lobby. If you have a chance, check it out. Something I didn't realize until we were about to leave: it's playing music.
