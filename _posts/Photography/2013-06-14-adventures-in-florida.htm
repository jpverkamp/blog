Our first big trip and everything went just about as well as could be expected. We (almost) had a tropical storm (awesome), were lazy, and found a fair few neat things to see/do. I wouldn't be opposed to going back there some day.

It had to have been the most liberal Catholic church I've ever been in... Personally, I'm a fan.

These are pretty much the only sunset shots I got. I had to stop in the middle of a run to do it... So worth it.
