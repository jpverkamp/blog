title: Silence II - Lonely Winter Night
---
I submitted "Lonely Winter Night" for the <a href="http://www.dpchallenge.com/image.php?IMAGE_ID=760176">Silence II</a> challenge at DPChallenge. I came in 110 out of 177 with a score of 4.96 / 10. So far this is my best result at DPChallenge. I think that I may have over done the softening on the shot, but I still think it was a cool effect.
