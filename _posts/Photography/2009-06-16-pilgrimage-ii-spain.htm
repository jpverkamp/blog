title: Pilgrimage II - Spain
---
As a class trip (Religion &amp; Ecology) through Rose-Hulman, myself, over a dozen other students, and two professors embarked on a pair of pilgrimages in Europe.  The first set of pictures (posted last night) is in England.  This set comes from the Camino de Santiago in Spain.
