I submitted "Death" for the <a href="http://www.dpchallenge.com/image.php?IMAGE_ID=837083">Macros Without Bugs or Flowers III</a> challenge at DPChallenge. I came in 170 out of 196 with a score of 4.38 / 10. Granted, it's not really a macro shot by the truest definition, but I did have a lot of fun reading the comments...
