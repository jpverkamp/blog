Several photosets from our family vacation on the west coast. We started in Phoenix, went to a few nearby things, then up the entire west coast to the Olympic Peninsula.

This is the first set, from Phoenix. We met up with my cousin who works for Intel there. Most are from a drive up to the area just north of Phoenix.

This is the second set, from the Grand Canyon (and a few from just before or after). This was one our longest stops so it's also probably going to be the largest photoset.

This is the third set, from the Hoover Dam (plus the rest stop before). A fair few fewer than the Grand Canyon, but I thing there are a few fine dam pictures.

This is the fourth set, from Amboy Crater. It wasn't on our schedule and we didn't even know it was there, but when we saw a sign saying 'Crater' we had to stop. Turns out it's a volcano. Who'da thunk?

The fifth set, up the coast. The first half are from Joshua Tree National Forest near Twentynine Palms where my cousin is stationed. The latter half are from Santa Barbara where we stopped for the beach and the night.

Finally to the sixth set. The first few are from a random stop on the way at Pismo Beach and the rest are stereotypical San Francisco shots.

The seventh set, with pictures from the redwoods and a few more coastal shots. The last few are from where we stayed that night in an awesome house tucked into a forest. Wow.

Number eight, up the west coast into Oregon. We're almost there. A few random pictures from a town we stopped in and the evening's sunset.

Number nine: Twilight. It's a combination of Forks, La Push, and Port Angeles. Definitely wasn't my primary reason for going, but I'll admit that La Push was pretty awesome. And it was neat being on the very northern end of the country.

Number ten, the final set. At this point, we'd been driving hard for two days to get back to Phoenix. We stopped in LA though, just so we could take a few pictures of the Hollywood sign.
