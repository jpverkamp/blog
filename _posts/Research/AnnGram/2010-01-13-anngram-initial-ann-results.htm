<strong>Overview</strong>

For now, I've chosen to work with <a href="http://franck.fleurey.free.fr/NeuralNetwork/">C# Neural network</a> library.  It was the easiest to get off the ground and running, so it seemed like a good place to start.

<strong>Measure of Similiarity</strong>

To complement the Cosine Similarity that I discussed earlier, the Neural Networks will be designed to take in two nGram documents (or authors) and return a number representing how similar the two are.  To that end, my initial plan is to determine the top 100 (for now) nGrams throughout all of the documents that I have and lock those as the inputs to the neural networks.  Then, the frequency of each of these will be fed in for both documents and a single number (the similarity) will be returned.  To train the networks, documents that should be the same will be forced towards a 1.0 and documents that should be different will be forced towards a 0.0.

<strong>Results </strong>

As you can see in the above image, the results are less than encouraging.  With the exception of 6-grams, the results are the same (nearly 0) for all of the examples, including both documents that should have been similar and ones that should not have been.

I expect that I either do not have enough information to feed to the neural networks or that the method that I described above is not well tuned to the problem at hand.  I intend to spend the next week looking into the problem.
