<strong>Overview</strong>

The first algorithm that I've chosen to implement is a simple cosine difference between the n-gram vectors.  This was the first method used in multiple of the papers that I've read and it seems like a good benchmark.

Essentially, this method gives the similarity of two n-gram documents (either Documents or Authors) as an angle ranging from 0 (identical documents) to @latex['inline]{\pi/2} (completely different documents).  Documents written by the same author should have the lowest values.

<strong>Equation</strong>

@latex|{ \theta = arccos \left ( \frac{a \cdot b}{|a||b|} \right ) }|

<strong>Example values</strong>

Comparing all of the works of Shakespeare with the Book of Genesis:
<ul>
	<li>n = 3, θ = 0.132</li>
	<li>n = 4, θ = 0.387</li>
	<li>n = 5, θ = 0.453</li>
	<li>n = 6, θ = 0.527</li>
	<li>average θ = 0.375</li>
</ul>
Comparing Shakespeare with one of his plays (As You Like It):
<ul>
	<li>n = 3, θ = 0.083</li>
	<li>n = 4, θ = 0.095</li>
	<li>n = 5, θ = 0.096</li>
	<li>n = 6, θ = 0.083</li>
	<li>average θ = 0.090</li>
</ul>
As you can see, the basic premise is valid.  Shakespeare is very similar to his own plays and much less so to the Book of Genesis.
