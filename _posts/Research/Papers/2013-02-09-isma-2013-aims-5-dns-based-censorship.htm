I gave a presentation about research that I'm just starting out studying DNS-based censorship in specific around the world. In particularly, preliminary findings in China have confirmed that the @wikipedia{Great Firewall} is responding via packet injection to many queries for either Facebook or Twitter (among others). Interestingly, the pool of IPs that they return is consistent yet none of the IPs seem to resolve to anything interesting. In addition, there is fallout in South Korea where some percentage of packets go through China and thus have the same behaviors.
