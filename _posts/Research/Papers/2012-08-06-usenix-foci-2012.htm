For the next week or so, I'll be in Seattle attending the Usenix Security Symposium and specifically the FOCI workshop. Why? Because I'm presenting a paper at FOCI.

EntitledÂ <em>Inferring Mechanics of Web Censorship Around the World</em>, here's the abstract:
<blockquote>While mechanics of Web censorship in China are well studied, those of other countries are less understood. Through a combination of personal contacts and Planet-Lab nodes, we conduct experiments to explore the mechanics of Web censorship in 11 countries around the world, including China. Our work provides insights into the diversity of modus operandi of censors around the world and can guide future work on censorship evasion.</blockquote>
You can download a PDF of the paper @embed[#:target "verkamp-foci-2012.pdf"]{here} and a copy of the slides @embed[#:target "verkamp-foci-2012-slides.pdf"]{here}.

With this, I've finally gotten around to making a website for any/all publications that I've had a part in which you can find at <a title="jverkamp - Research" href="http://research.jverkamp.com/">http://research.jverkamp.com</a>. There are links there both to full version of this paper and to all of the other research papers that I've written over the years. Looking back, it's quite a strange combination. I guess that's what I get for being a bit interested in everything.
